browser which integrates with existing language workbenches whilst exploring new approaches The modelix project develops an open source platform for (meta-)models on the web. We are native to the web and the cloud, inspired by this whitepaper[1]. On the path to this final idea, we currently develop multiple interoperable components that implement parts of our vision. Consequently, some parts are very stable and already in productive use while others are in a more experimental and explorative state. To gain an overview over components, head over to the Components of modelix reference. Follow the 'Next' button in the bottom right to find out more details on our current roadmap, or dive directly into our sample project to get started! Otherwise, the How-To section serves as an implicit FAQ which might give answers to some of your immediate questions. This is the full modelix documentation for modelix version main. You can choose different versions at the bottom left of this page. This documentation brings together the documentation from all individual modelix components. We follow the systematic Diátaxis[2] approach in this documentation. As a result, we separate the documentation in the following four mayor categories: Tutorials (learning-oriented) Lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. New users usually start here. How-To Guides Reference There is also a dedicated API page where you can find component specific API documentaion over at https://api.docs.modelix.org. Explanation This documentation is built using the Antora framework. All individual software components contain their own documentation within their own repository but are aggregated here. The playbook for aggregation and central source source for this documentation can be found in the modelix/modelix.doc repository. If you find any bugs or errors in our documentation please add pull requests or issues in the corresponding repository. In this documentation we use various acronyms and domain-specific wording. Head over to the Glossary if you are unsure about what exactly we mean when talking about a model, meta-model, MPS, or others.

MPS is running in headless mode on the server with an HTTP server installed as a plugin. The browser connects to that server and receives the HTML and JavaScript code required for the interactive model editor. A second plugin connects to a model-server and replicates the data into MPS’ internal module repository. All MPS instances connected to that model server will stay synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor. Both options are supported at the same time. The next image gives an overview over the different docker images running in the kubernetes cluster. The model server uses an Apache Ignite cluster and just provides a REST API on top of it. A high load can be distributed over multiple instances. Running multiple MPS instances for scalability is possible, because the model has the same state on all instances. If you want to run MPS instances with different configurations (languages, plugins) or allow external instances to connect to the model server, a reverse proxy is used to forward the request to the correct instance. To access the web editor a user has to login in with a google account first. An OAuth proxy takes care of that and adds an HTTP header with the users e-mail address to the request. modelix provides an editor in the browser for the languages implemented in MPS. This can be an image based editor that renders the editor in MPS using the default editor definition or an HTML based editor that requires a separate editor definition in a language provided by modelix. Common to both approaches is that the user input (keyboard, mouse) is processed on the server and the update of the projection after a model change also happens on the server. Even in case of the HTML based editor the resulting HTML is computed on the server side. This removes the need to replicate the model into the browser, which would result in a bad performance in case of big models. Running MPS in the cloud requires an alternative to the file system for storing models. modelix implements a data structure that allows replication between all MPS instances connected to the same model server. It is very similar to the git storage format, but instead of files it stores nodes in its key-value data store. To support realtime collaboration, in addition to the snapshot of a version it also stores the operations that were applied on the previous version to produce the new version. Conflicts between concurrent modification are resolved using operational transformation (OT). The usually hard part of OT is to guarantee convergence, meaning that all clients end up with the same result indepent of the order in which they receive changes. This problem becomes trivial, because versions are identified by a hash over all the content. Any divergence will result in a different hash which can easily be detected. The remaining problem is what to do when a divergence is detected. From git we know that switching between versions is fast, because it only has to apply the difference between these versions. The same is true here. Fixing a divergence is as easy as switching to the correct version. If a client doesn’t have any local changes it doesn’t even need to apply the change operations itself. It can just switch to the new version. So in the rare case of a divergence fixing it is nothing special.

Modelix is a platform to bring models to the web. It consists of multiple components, which can be combined in different ways to support a variety of use cases. It is important to note, that modelix is neither a language workbench in the traditional sense nor a one-size-fits-all solution. The modelix project aims to provide you with building blocks, which empower you to construct your own application with ease. The following table gives an overview over essential components, which you are very likely to encounter when using modelix. For a full list of components check out the components table. Component Short description model-api Untyped API, which allows to interact with models. model-server Server, which persistently stores models. model-client Client, which implements the model-api and connects to a model-server. model-api-gen(-gradle) Component, which generates a typed, domain specific API based on a metamodel definition. The generated API wraps the untyped model-api. As a basic example, you might want to create a web app, which manipulates domain-specific models. In this case we assume a metamodel for such models exists as part of an MPS project. The image above shows how the essential components work together to form the backend for a web application. In this case the metamodel definition is generated from the structure aspect of a language in MPS. For a different use case it could also be from another (custom) source. The web application can then use the domain-specific API to manipulate and store models in the model-server. Of course, this example only scratches the surface of what is possible with modelix. Apart from the individual components, modelix can also provide a system called workspaces. It consists of multiple docker images, which run in a kubernetes cluster. Among other features, this system enables users to use projectional editors inside their browser by running MPS instances in the cloud. Modelix is always evolving.

We are dedicated to bring an updated version during December 2023 after our already scheduled planning sessions. Please check the documentation in the main branch of modelix. The following image shows a dense overview of our current roadmap. The aim of this roadmap is to provide you with a more detailed overview of our plans. We have compiled a catalog of our significant areas, which are our top priorities we focus on delivering. In the following we shortly list these key priorities. Below you can find more detailed explanations for each of these. Model APIs: A unified low-level API to navigate and modify models. It is untyped to any existing meta-model. Domain-Specific Model API generator: A complete rewrite of our initial API generator which overcomes multiple previous shortcomings. It provides type information and directly integrates with the model API. Versioning / Releases / Roadmap: Automated semantic versioning with unifying modelix platform releases twice a year. Development is planned over at issues.modelix.org. Documentation: Docs-as-code approach which is built to docs.modelix.org with every platform release. Git integration: A tighter integration for git based model storage to bridge legacy storage solutions. MPS in the Cloud: Run MPS in the cloud as a way to transition to the web. Language Evolution: A way to handle new language versions and metamodel changes. Graphical Editors: We plan to provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API to enable graphical editors on the wev. LIonWeb: Integration with other web components out there - modelix support and involvement in the LIonWeb (Language interfaces on the web) initiative. Several modelix artifacts had potentially confusing names. We streamlined everything and renamed to convey functionality more clearly. Check out our blog post for details. Also check the new table of modelix component overview here. Modelix uses a low level meta-model agnostic API across all components. The model-api provides this abstraction. This API is the shared basis and used across all modelix components. It is a Kotlin multi-platform implementation with artifacts for JVM and JS. An untyped access to model content is possible when only using the model-api. In case you want to use typed access, the model-api-gen provides a generator which generates a typed model API from your existing domain-specific meta-model. This generated API specializes the untyped model-api and provides domain grounded model access. Up to now, the model API generator api-gen was used to generate a domain-specific Java model API from a MPS structure. These classes can then be used in web applications to obtain typed model content from the model-server. The api-gen was implemented as a MPS generator and consequently bound to and limited by the MPS ecosystem. To overcome the many shortcomings we observed (runtime & resource usage, tool lock-in, maintainability, few target languages). We re-implement the generator (now model-api-gen`) in Kotlin, which has several benefits. Most notably, there is now an additional option to generate a domain-specific TypeScript API. One extra feature we add is MPS meta-model independence: In a new intermediate step, we export the MPS structure to a JSON representation re-using the JSON language of the existing MPS extensions. This intermediate artifact is then used by the api-gen v2 to generate the APIs. The MPS structure to JSON generator is available for all MPS versions so that previous maintenance of the api-gen v1 for multiple MPS versions is not necessary any more. To ease the use of the new model-api-gen, we provide a Gradle plugin to help setting up the domain-specific API generation: model-api-gen-gradle. With many modelix components being in various development stages - from stable to early and conceptual - they are released individually. Generally, modelix follows the Semantic Versioning scheme for releases and groups different components by repository (e.g. core components are in modelix.core, while documentation resides in modelix.docs). However, anything based on JetBrains MPS (e.g. MPS plugins or extensions) is prefixed with the corresponding MPS major and minor version number followed by our own patch version number. For example, the org.modelix.mps-model-plugin version 2021.2.103 is the 103rd release which is compatible with MPS 2021.2. To make it easier for developers, the modelix platform will be released twice a year as a single modelix platform release which aggregates all compatible component versions. We aim to provide a Spring release (modelix-2X.1) and an Autumn release (modelix-2X.2). All development in-between is carried out as patches on the releases. This release cycle starts from 2023 with the first release on the MPS Community meetup in May: modelix-23.1. For the different MPS versions there are sub-platforms that also bundle the corresponding MPS plugins of the modelix platform. The artifacts which hold the Gradle platform thus will be org.modelix.platform` org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-2 org.modelix.platform-mps-2020-3 org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-1 org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-3 Additionally, we want to communicate our plans for the modelix platform more clearly. As a result we prepared a roadmap outlining our planned steps. Further, on issues.modelix.org we also give more insights in our development efforts. To further reduce the barrier of entry to modelix with modelix-23.1 we deploy new documentation following the docs-as-code approach. You can access the new documentation over at docs.modelix.org which is available for each modelix platform release. We follow the Diataxis documentation framework to separate and communicate more clearly in the categories of Tutorials, How To Guides, Explanation, and (technical) Reference. Additionally api.modelix.org provides a generated technical API reference which we grow incrementally. Generally, we recommend using the model-server as the storage backend for models in the cloud. However, in some environments and use cases, this philosophy can only partially be archived. In rare cases we observe a hybrid setup where a) model knowledge is stored in files as MPS projects in combination with git while b) deploying web and cloud centric applications using the model-server. In a first iteration, we want to provide the possibility for read and write of MPS models from and to git repositories in the modelix platform. This could eventually also include the usage of the model-server for real-time collaboration in these hybrid setups. However, this is a topic which requires further investigation. For many MPS based projects, a good first step for transitioning to the web is running MPS in the cloud. modelix already has elaborate prototypes for these use-cases by using Kubernetes and Projector to provide MPS “Workspaces” in the cloud. One central piece for this are the modelix build-tools. This component allows the generation of MPS languages without any existing build script. We want to refine our efforts regarding MPS in the cloud and make them more accessible. When using MPS, model migrations are made easy using the migration aspect. However, once stepping outside of MPS, migrations become more difficult. Model migration needs to be carried out across platforms, teams and (web) applications when a new language version is deployed. We want to support a generated APIs that can work with multiple versions at the same time with which we also can support meta-model versions checks for compatibility. We have some ideas we need to further refine and explore in the following releases. The experience from MPS shows that the requirements for a graphical editor are too diverse to support all of them with a single framework. There are many different frameworks available in the web world where you can choose the one that fits your use case. We plan to only provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API, but not the integration of any diagram framework itself. Modelix focuses on a good integration with MPS. If you are interested in the integration of other modeling technologies then check out the LIonWeb project (short for Language Interfaces on the web). They specify more general interfaces and use the modelix model-server for data storage and exchange in their current prototypes. The modelix team co-authored and is involved with the LIonWeb initiative.","title":"Roadmap","component":"modelix","version":"main","name":"roadmap","url":"/modelix/main/main/roadmap.html","titles":[{"text":"Key priorities overview","hash":"_key_priorities_overview","id":1},{"text":"Component Renaming (23.1)","hash":"_component_renaming_23_1","id":2},{"text":"Model APIs (23.1)","hash":"_model_apis_23_1","id":3},{"text":"Domain-Specific Model API Generator (23.1)","hash":"_domain_specific_model_api_generator_23_1","id":4},{"text":"Versioning / Releases / Roadmap (23.1)","hash":"_versioning_releases_roadmap_23_1","id":5},{"text":"Documentation (23.1)","hash":"_documentation_23_1","id":6},{"text":"Git Integration (estimated 23.2)","hash":"_git_integration_estimated_23_2","id":7},{"text":"MPS in the Cloud (estimated 23.2)","hash":"_mps_in_the_cloud_estimated_23_2","id":8},{"text":"Language Evolution (estimated 24.1)","hash":"_language_evolution_estimated_24_1","id":9},{"text":"Graphical Editors in the Web (estimated 24.2)","hash":"_graphical_editors_in_the_web_estimated_24_2","id":10},{"text":"LIonWeb","hash":"_lionweb","id":11}]},"12":{"id":12,"text":"This page represents a fallback page for open TODOs within the documentation.

Each use case uses different components from the modelix platform to create custom solutions. On this page, you can get an overview of all use cases, and see how they are related and what their essential differences are. In the first use case, an MPS project is synchronized to a repository on a model server by utilizing the model-server-sync-plugin. It shows how to make model data, previously accessible only in a running MPS or via files, available through a server. In itself, this use case has little value, but the next use cases build in part on it. See the Use case 1 page for details. In this use case, we connect web frontends to a model server. The web frontends read from and write model data to the model server. One web frontend can be used to edit model data and is implemented with Vue.js. The other one serves as an overview and is implemented with Angular. You can see how changes made in one connected application are instantly reflected in another connected application. You can also connect an MPS to the model server and see how changes made in the application are synced to MPS and vice versa. The frontend applications directly use the model-client JavaScript library that connects to the model server. They also use a TypeScript API generated by the Model API generator from the metamodel to enable type-safe access to data structures provided by the model client. See the Use case 2 page for details. In this use case, a web frontend connects to a web backend, which in turn communicates with a model server. Like in use case 2 model data is synced automatically between the model server, the application and MPS. A backend is needed if you need to control what data a client might read and write. It is also useful to translate data from modelix data structures into a data structure that is suitable for your web applications. The web backend is implemented with Quarkus. It uses the model-client to connect to a model server. It also uses a Kotlin API generated by the Model API generator from the metamodel to enable type-safe access to data structures provided by the model client. For the Angular based web frontend, the web backend provides a custom HTTP- and websocket-based API.

A backend is needed if you need to control what data a client might read and write. It is also useful to translate data from modelix data structures into a data structure that is suitable for your web applications. The web backend is implemented in Quarkus. It communicates to the model server using the model-client. The data communicated between the model server and web backend are modelix-specific data structures without information about the metamodel. In the backend, those data structures are wrapped with generated Kotlin classes generated by the Model API generator from the metamodel. The backend programmer can use this so-called domain-specific-language API to access model data more type-safely. The web backend exposes a custom application-specific API, which the web frontend uses to communicate and read and write data. The web backend, therefore: controls how data is read and written to the model server. hides details about modelix-specific data structures and domain-specific-language API. Figure 1.

While the data structure for model replication in Modelix supports partial loading of models, you still need a way to describe which data you need on the client. Loading data on demand while traversing the model also results in a poor performance, because of the potentially large number of fine-grained request. A first attempt to solve this problem was to disallow lazy loading and require the client to load all required data at the beginning, before working with the model. A special query language was used to filter the data and an attempt to access a node that is not included by that query resulted in an exception, forcing the developer to adjust the query. While this results in a more predictable performance, it is also hard to maintain and still not optimal for the performance. You have to download all the data at the beginning that you might eventually need, potentially exceeding the available memory of the system. The ModelQL query language provides a more dynamic way of loading parts of the model on demand, but still allows reducing the number of request to a minimum. The downside is that it’s not just a different implementation hidden behind the model-api, but requires to use a different API. The query language is inspired by Reactive Streams and the execution engine uses Kotlin Flows, which is a Coroutines compatible implementation of Reactive Streams. Often it’s useful to know if a stream is expected to return only one element or multiple elements. Project Reactor, another implementation of Reactive Streams, introduced the notion of Mono and Flux to distinguish them. You will also find them in ModelQL.","title":"ModelQL","component":"modelix","version":"main","name":"modelql","url":"/modelix/main/core/explanation/modelql.html","titles":[{"text":"Reactive Streams","hash":"_reactive_streams","id":1}]},"27":{"id":27,"text":"TODO","title":"modelix.core How-To","component":"modelix","version":"main","name":"index","url":"/modelix/main/core/howto/index.html","titles":[]},"28":{"id":28,"text":"ModelQL defines its own HTTP endpoint and provides server/client implementations for it. The model-server and the mps-model-server-plugin already implement this endpoint. The client can be created like this: val client = ModelQLClient.builder().url(\"http://localhost/query\").httpClient(httpClient).build() val result: List = client.query { root -> root.children(\"modules\").property(\"name\").toList() } When creating a LightModelClient you can optionally provide a ModelQLClient instance, which allows invoking .query { …​ } (see below) on a node returned by the LightModelClient. val modelqlClient = ModelQLClient.builder().build() val client = LightModelClient.builder().modelQLClient(modelqlClient).build() val result: List = client.getRootNode()!!.query { it.children(\"modules\").property(\"name\").toList() } You can use the model-api-gen-gradle plugin to generate type safe extensions from your meta-model. Specify the modelqlKotlinDir property to enable the generation. val result: List = client.query { root -> root.children(\"classes\").ofConcept(C_ClassConcept) .member .ofConcept(C_StaticMethodDeclaration) .filter { it.visibility.instanceOf(C_PublicVisibility) } .toList() } If a query returns a node, you can execute a new query starting from that node. val cls: ClassConcept = client.query { it.children(\"classes\").ofConcept(C_ClassConcept).first() } val names = cls.query { it.member.ofConcept(C_StaticMethodDeclaration).name.toList() } For convenience, it’s possible to access further data of that node using the INode API, but this is not recommended though, because each access sends a new query to the server. val cls: ClassConcept = client.query { it.children(\"classes\").ofConcept(C_ClassConcept).first() } val className = cls.name While returning a list of elements is simple, the purpose of the query language is to reduce the number of request to a minimum. This requires combining multiple values into more complex data structures. The zip operation provides a simple way of doing that: val result: List>> = query { db -> db.products.map { val id = it.id val title = it.title val images = it.images.toList() id.zip(title, images) }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.first}, Title: ${it.second}, Images: ${it.third}\") } This is suitable for combining a small number of values, but because of the missing variable names it can be hard to read for a larger number of values or even multiple zip operations assembled into a hierarchical data structure. This can be solved by defining custom data classes and using the mapLocal operation: data class MyProduct(val id: Int, val title: String, val images: List) data class MyImage(val url: String) val result: List = remoteProductDatabaseQuery { db -> db.products.map { val id = it.id val title = it.title val images = it.images.mapLocal { MyImage(it) }.toList() id.zip(title, images).mapLocal { MyProduct(it.first, it.second, it.third) } }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.id}, Title: ${it.title}, Images: ${it.images}\") } The mapLocal operation is not just useful in combination with the zip operation, but in general to create instances of classes only known to the client. The body of mapLocal is executed on the client after receiving the result from the server. That’s why you only have access to the output of the zip operation and still have to use first, second and third inside the query. To make this even more readable there is a buildLocalMapping operation, which provides a different syntax for the zip-mapLocal chain. data class MyProduct(val id: Int, val title: String, val images: List) data class MyImage(val url: String) val result: List = query { db -> db.products.buildLocalMapping { val id = it.id.request() val title = it.title.request() val images = it.images.mapLocal { MyImage(it) }.toList().request() onSuccess { MyProduct(id.get(), title.get(), images.get()) } }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.id}, Title: ${it.title}, Images: ${it.images}\") } At the beginning of the buildLocalMapping body, you invoke request() on all the values you need to assemble your object. This basically adds the operand to the internal zip operation and returns an object that gives you access to the value after receiving it from the server. Inside the onSuccess block you assemble the local object using the previously requested values. One use case of the query language is to build database applications that generate HTML pages from the data stored in the model server. You can use the Kotlin HTML DSL together with ModelQL to do that. Use buildHtmlQuery to request data from the server and render it into an HTML string: val html = query { it.map(buildHtmlQuery { val modules = input.children(\"modules\").requestFragment { val moduleName = input.property(\"name\").request() val models = input.children(\"models\").requestFragment { val modelName = input.property(\"name\").request() onSuccess { div { h2 { +\"Model: ${modelName.get()}\" } } } } onSuccess { div { h1 { +\"Module: ${moduleName.get()}\" } insertFragment(models) } } } onSuccess { body { insertFragment(modules) } } }) } buildHtmlQuery and the requestFragment operation are similar to the buildLocalMapping operation, but inside the onSuccess block you use the Kotlin HTML DSL.","title":"ModelQL","component":"modelix","version":"main","name":"modelql","url":"/modelix/main/core/howto/modelql.html","titles":[{"text":"Independent ModelQLClient","hash":"_independent_modelqlclient","id":1},{"text":"Integration with LightModelClient","hash":"_integration_with_lightmodelclient","id":2},{"text":"Type-safe ModelQL API","hash":"_type_safe_modelql_api","id":3},{"text":"Run query on an INode","hash":"_run_query_on_an_inode","id":4},{"text":"Complex query results","hash":"_complex_query_results","id":5},{"text":"Kotlin HTML integration","hash":"_kotlin_html_integration","id":6}]},"29":{"id":29,"text":"If you want to test code that processes model-api instances, you can do this in-process without a running (light-) model-server.

Generator. It provides an additional Gradle task which will apply a 2-staged process: MPS metamodel export to JSON (optional) In the first step the metamodel-export MPS solution is executed by the plugin to export the MPS structure aspect (i.e. the metamodel) to JSON files. In case your metamodel comes from another source this is an external entry point: As long as you can export your metamodel to JSON, you can use model-api-gen. To use JSON from another source or JSON files from a previous export, you can skip this step by simply specifying a directory, which contains the JSON files, in the configuration of the gradle task: metamodel { //... jsonDir = File(\"path/to/json/dir\") } As a result, all MPS-specific configuration settings will be ignored and the specified directory will be used for the next step.

Bringing models to the cloud requires an alternative to the file system (and git) based storage of models. Modelix implements a data structure that allows replication between all MPS instances connected to the same model-server. It is very similar to the git storage format, but instead of files it stores nodes in its key-value data store. To support real-time collaboration, in addition to the snapshot of a version, the model-server also stores the operations that were applied on the previous version to produce the new version. Conflicts between concurrent modification are resolved using operational transformation (OT). The usually hard part of OT is to guarantee convergence, meaning that all clients end up with the same result independent of the order in which they receive changes. This problem becomes trivial, because versions are identified by a hash over all the content. Any divergence will result in a different hash which can easily be detected. The remaining problem is what to do when a divergence is detected. From git we know that switching between versions is fast, because it only has to apply the difference between these versions. The same is true here: Fixing a divergence is as easy as switching to the correct version. If a client does not have any local changes it does not even need to apply the change operations itself - it can just switch to the new version. So in the rare case of a divergence fixing it is nothing special and is an operation that happens all the time. While this component is independent of MPS, it is possible to replicates the data of the MPS internal module repository into a running model-server. This can be achieved using the modelix MPS plugin: One can connect an MPS instances to a model-server, upload the current module repository, and keep it synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor - both options are supported at the same time.

MPS is running in headless mode on the server with an HTTP server installed as a plugin. The browser connects to that server and receives the HTML and JavaScript code required for the interactive model editor. A second plugin connects to a model-server and replicates the data into MPS’ internal module repository. All MPS instances connected to that model server will stay synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor. Both options are supported at the same time. The next image gives an overview over the different docker images running in the kubernetes cluster. The model server uses an Apache Ignite cluster and just provides a REST API on top of it. A high load can be distributed over multiple instances. Running multiple MPS instances for scalability is possible, because the model has the same state on all instances. If you want to run MPS instances with different configurations (languages, plugins) or allow external instances to connect to the model server, a reverse proxy is used to forward the request to the correct instance. To access the web editor a user has to login in with a google account first. An OAuth proxy takes care of that and adds an HTTP header with the users e-mail address to the request. modelix provides an editor in the browser for the languages implemented in MPS. This can be an image based editor that renders the editor in MPS using the default editor definition or an HTML based editor that requires a separate editor definition in a language provided by modelix. Common to both approaches is that the user input (keyboard, mouse) is processed on the server and the update of the projection after a model change also happens on the server. Even in case of the HTML based editor the resulting HTML is computed on the server side. This removes the need to replicate the model into the browser, which would result in a bad performance in case of big models. Running MPS in the cloud requires an alternative to the file system for storing models. modelix implements a data structure that allows replication between all MPS instances connected to the same model server. It is very similar to the git storage format, but instead of files it stores nodes in its key-value data store. To support realtime collaboration, in addition to the snapshot of a version it also stores the operations that were applied on the previous version to produce the new version. Conflicts between concurrent modification are resolved using operational transformation (OT). The usually hard part of OT is to guarantee convergence, meaning that all clients end up with the same result indepent of the order in which they receive changes. This problem becomes trivial, because versions are identified by a hash over all the content. Any divergence will result in a different hash which can easily be detected. The remaining problem is what to do when a divergence is detected. From git we know that switching between versions is fast, because it only has to apply the difference between these versions. The same is true here. Fixing a divergence is as easy as switching to the correct version. If a client doesn’t have any local changes it doesn’t even need to apply the change operations itself. It can just switch to the new version. So in the rare case of a divergence fixing it is nothing special. It’s an operation that happens all the time.","title":"Architecture","component":"modelix","version":"23.1","name":"architecture","url":"/modelix/23.1/explanation/architecture.html","titles":[{"text":"An architectural overview of the modelix project","hash":"_an_architectural_overview_of_the_modelix_project","id":1},{"text":"Editor","hash":"_editor","id":2},{"text":"Model","hash":"_model","id":3}]},"49":{"id":49,"text":"This glossary is a lose collection of keywords used throughout the modelix documentation.

All components and software of the platform as well as issue tracking and project management are done in repositories in our GitHub organisation. Currently, we use GitHub actions to build, test, and publish the components. We deploy all relevant artifacts to the itemis Nexus server as well as GitHub Packages Issues are managed in our issue tracker over at https://issues.modelix.org. With many components being in various development stages - from stable to early and conceptual - they are released individually for each repository. Generally, we follow the Semantic versioning scheme for releases. However, anything based on JetBrains MPS (e.g. MPS plugins or extensions) are prefixed with the corresponding MPS major and minor version number followed by our own patch version number. For example, the org.modelix.mps-model-plugin version 2021.2.103 is the 103rd release which is compatible with MPS 2021.2.*. To make it easier for developers, the modelix platform is currently released twice a year as a single \"platform release\" which references compatible component versions. We aim to provide a Spring release R1 and an Autumn release R2. All development in-between is carried out as patches on the releases. This release cycle starts from 2023 with the first release on the MPS Community meetup in May: 2023.R1. To gain an overview over existing components, please refer to the list of components here. The following image shows a dense overview of our current roadmap. The aim of this roadmap is to provide you with a more detailed overview of our plans. We have compiled a catalog of our significant areas, which are our top priorities we focus on delivering. In the following we shortly list these key priorities. Below you can find more detailed explanations for each of these. Model APIs: A unified low-level API to navigate and modify models. It is untyped to any existing meta-model. Domain-Specific Model API generator: A complete rewrite of our initial API generator which overcomes multiple previous shortcomings. It provides type information and directly integrates with the model API. Versioning / Releases / Roadmap: Automated semantic versioning with unifying modelix platform releases twice a year. Development is planned over at issues.modelix.org. Documentation: Docs-as-code approach which is built to docs.modelix.org with every platform release. Git integration: A tighter integration for git based model storage to bridge legacy storage solutions. MPS in the Cloud: Run MPS in the cloud as a way to transition to the web. Language Evolution: A way to handle new language versions and metamodel changes. Graphical Editors: We plan to provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API to enable graphical editors on the wev. LIonWeb: Integration with other web components out there - modelix support and involvement in the LIonWeb (Language interfaces on the web) initiative. Several modelix artifacts had potentially confusing names. We streamlined everything and renamed to convey functionality more clearly. Check out our blog post for details. Also check the new table of modelix component overview here. Modelix uses a low level meta-model agnostic API across all components. The model-api provides this abstraction. This API is the shared basis and used across all modelix components. It is a Kotlin multi-platform implementation with artifacts for JVM and JS. An untyped access to model content is possible when only using the model-api. In case you want to use typed access, the model-api-gen provides a generator which generates a typed model API from your existing domain-specific meta-model. This generated API specializes the untyped model-api and provides domain grounded model access. Up to now, the model API generator api-gen was used to generate a domain-specific Java model API from a MPS structure. These classes can then be used in web applications to obtain typed model content from the model-server. The api-gen was implemented as a MPS generator and consequently bound to and limited by the MPS ecosystem. To overcome the many shortcomings we observed (runtime & resource usage, tool lock-in, maintainability, few target languages). We re-implement the generator (now model-api-gen`) in Kotlin, which has several benefits. Most notably, there is now an additional option to generate a domain-specific TypeScript API. One extra feature we add is MPS meta-model independence: In a new intermediate step, we export the MPS structure to a JSON representation re-using the JSON language of the existing MPS extensions. This intermediate artifact is then used by the api-gen v2 to generate the APIs. The MPS structure to JSON generator is available for all MPS versions so that previous maintenance of the api-gen v1 for multiple MPS versions is not necessary any more. To ease the use of the new model-api-gen, we provide a Gradle plugin to help setting up the domain-specific API generation: model-api-gen-gradle. With many modelix components being in various development stages - from stable to early and conceptual - they are released individually. Generally, modelix follows the Semantic Versioning scheme for releases and groups different components by repository (e.g. core components are in modelix.core, while documentation resides in modelix.docs). However, anything based on JetBrains MPS (e.g. MPS plugins or extensions) is prefixed with the corresponding MPS major and minor version number followed by our own patch version number. For example, the org.modelix.mps-model-plugin version 2021.2.103 is the 103rd release which is compatible with MPS 2021.2. To make it easier for developers, the modelix platform will be released twice a year as a single modelix platform release which aggregates all compatible component versions. We aim to provide a Spring release (modelix-2X.1) and an Autumn release (modelix-2X.2). All development in-between is carried out as patches on the releases. This release cycle starts from 2023 with the first release on the MPS Community meetup in May: modelix-23.1. For the different MPS versions there are sub-platforms that also bundle the corresponding MPS plugins of the modelix platform. The artifacts which hold the Gradle platform thus will be org.modelix.platform` org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-2 org.modelix.platform-mps-2020-3 org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-1 org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-3 Additionally, we want to communicate our plans for the modelix platform more clearly. As a result we prepared a roadmap outlining our planned steps. Further, on issues.modelix.org we also give more insights in our development efforts. To further reduce the barrier of entry to modelix with modelix-23.1 we deploy new documentation following the docs-as-code approach. You can access the new documentation over at docs.modelix.org which is available for each modelix platform release. We follow the Diataxis documentation framework to separate and communicate more clearly in the categories of Tutorials, How To Guides, Explanation, and (technical) Reference. Additionally api.modelix.org provides a generated technical API reference which we grow incrementally. Generally, we recommend using the model-server as the storage backend for models in the cloud. However, in some environments and use cases, this philosophy can only partially be archived. In rare cases we observe a hybrid setup where a) model knowledge is stored in files as MPS projects in combination with git while b) deploying web and cloud centric applications using the model-server. In a first iteration, we want to provide the possibility for read and write of MPS models from and to git repositories in the modelix platform. This could eventually also include the usage of the model-server for real-time collaboration in these hybrid setups. However, this is a topic which requires further investigation. For many MPS based projects, a good first step for transitioning to the web is running MPS in the cloud. modelix already has elaborate prototypes for these use-cases by using Kubernetes and Projector to provide MPS “Workspaces” in the cloud. One central piece for this are the modelix build-tools. This component allows the generation of MPS languages without any existing build script. We want to refine our efforts regarding MPS in the cloud and make them more accessible. When using MPS, model migrations are made easy using the migration aspect. However, once stepping outside of MPS, migrations become more difficult. Model migration needs to be carried out across platforms, teams and (web) applications when a new language version is deployed. We want to support a generated APIs that can work with multiple versions at the same time with which we also can support meta-model versions checks for compatibility. We have some ideas we need to further refine and explore in the following releases. The experience from MPS shows that the requirements for a graphical editor are too diverse to support all of them with a single framework. There are many different frameworks available in the web world where you can choose the one that fits your use case. We plan to only provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API, but not the integration of any diagram framework itself. Modelix focuses on a good integration with MPS. If you are interested in the integration of other modeling technologies then check out the LIonWeb project (short for Language Interfaces on the web). They specify more general interfaces and use the modelix model-server for data storage and exchange in their current prototypes. The modelix team co-authored and is involved with the LIonWeb initiative.","title":"Development, Releases, and Roadmap","component":"modelix","version":"23.1","name":"roadmap","url":"/modelix/23.1/main/roadmap.html","titles":[{"text":"Development","hash":"_development","id":1},{"text":"Release Cycle","hash":"_release_cycle","id":2},{"text":"Roadmap","hash":"_roadmap","id":3},{"text":"Key priorities overview","hash":"_key_priorities_overview","id":4},{"text":"Component Renaming (23.1)","hash":"_component_renaming_23_1","id":5},{"text":"Model APIs (23.1)","hash":"_model_apis_23_1","id":6},{"text":"Domain-Specific Model API Generator (23.1)","hash":"_domain_specific_model_api_generator_23_1","id":7},{"text":"Versioning / Releases / Roadmap (23.1)","hash":"_versioning_releases_roadmap_23_1","id":8},{"text":"Documentation (23.1)","hash":"_documentation_23_1","id":9},{"text":"Git Integration (estimated 23.2)","hash":"_git_integration_estimated_23_2","id":10},{"text":"MPS in the Cloud (estimated 23.2)","hash":"_mps_in_the_cloud_estimated_23_2","id":11},{"text":"Language Evolution (estimated 24.1)","hash":"_language_evolution_estimated_24_1","id":12},{"text":"Graphical Editors in the Web (estimated 24.2)","hash":"_graphical_editors_in_the_web_estimated_24_2","id":13},{"text":"LIonWeb","hash":"_lionweb","id":14}]},"55":{"id":55,"text":"This page represents a fallback page for open TODOs within the documentation.

This layer is meant educational as no noteworthy abstractions from the language itself happen in this definition. It intends to show how one introduces a clearly defined domain-specific abstraction decoupling the language engineering (meta-modeling) and the web development. We provide two backends (i.e. implementations of the API layer): The API via modelQL and API via model-server components. ▶️ For more details, see the OpenAPI component documentation. This project provides two implementations of the openapi domain abstraction. MPS as a source This backend provides access to the model by obtaining the model knowledge directly from a running MPS instance. It is implemented using ktor and connects to a model-client plugin running inside of MPS. This component can only provide read and write access. ▶️ For more details, see the API via modelQL for details. model-server as a source This backend provides access to the model by connecting to a running model-server. It is implemented using Quarkus and can provide read access to the underlying model. Additionally, a websocket for push notifications about ongoing model changes is provided. This is realized using websockets exposed by the model-server. ▶️ For more details, also see the API via model-server component for details. The dashboard provides access to model knowledge through a browser. As it is conforming to the OpenAPI specification, the dashboard is able to obtain the model content from both backend implementations.

The SPA Dashboard Figure 2. View on a single Lecture in the Dashboard This component provides a single page application which accesses an implementation of the sample OpenAPI specification. The idea here is to illustrate a read only use-case where a system/service outside of MPS wants to consume the content of models previously defined in MPS. This dashboard is a single-page app showing content obtained from the intermediate REST APIs. A user cannot edit these models from the browser. It does not matter whether MPS is used to store the model information (e.g. by running an MPS instance in the cloud), or alternatively the modelix model-server is used. You can build this subproject individually from the parent folder via via Gradle: ./gradlew spa-dashboard-angular:build To run this application you will need a component which provides an API implementation conforming to the OpenAPI spec. Thus, you need to start one of the available OpenAPI implementations in this project: Either start the rest-api-model-ql implementation, or alternatively you can start the rest-api-model-server implementation. Check the documentation of the corresponding project parts on how to start them. Make sure you have the correct ports defined in the API URLs. This app expects 8090 by default. Next run this single page application via: ./gradlew spa-dashboard-angular:npmRun You can then go to http://localhost:4200 to see a dashboard with the courses model content.","title":"Single page application: An Angular based dashboard","component":"modelix","version":"23.1","name":"dashboard","url":"/modelix/23.1/samples/reference/dashboard.html","titles":[{"text":"Building & Running","hash":"_building_running","id":1},{"text":"1.

The language itself is fairly small: It describes a very simplified lecture schedule. The language intentionally does not use expressions, creating editors for expressions by hand is very cumbersome and at the time where these samples were created modelix has no support for generating these editors for you. The main concepts of the language are: Room: where lecture are held. Each room has a maximum capacity of students, a name and some additional properties. Lecture: Have a name, some description and reference a room where they are held. And also have a schedule which determines when they are held and if they repeat through the whole semester or are a one time lecture. Student: A student with a name and birthday. Assignment: Lecture assignments for a single student. Some concepts are contained a root node like a Rooms container to make structuring the editors in MPS easier: classDiagram class Rooms { > } class Courses { > } class Students { > } class LectureAssignments { > } Rooms *-- Room : 0..n Courses *-- Lecture: 0..n Lecture ..

This limitation is specific this example and is somehow caused by the MPS build failing to load the right languages during the build. Other projects are successfully using the api-gen code generator within their CI/gradle build.

These components include among others the model-server, model-api-gen, model-api-gen-gradle, and light-model-client. All components in this repository have no dependencies to JetBrains MPS. The modelix project uses Gradle to build the individual components. Simply call the following in the top level folder of a repository: ./gradlew build # mac/linux or if you are on windows use: gradlew.bat build # windows Wherever possible we use the latest IntelliJ IDEA IDE to manage projects in our repositories. Consequently, opening any repository with IntelliJ will also allow you to build and eventually contribute. At the moment most modelix artifacts are stored on the itemis nexus with no access restriction. As a consequence, when you build modelix or use modelix components via Gradle there is no repository access setup required. This is optional when you want to obtain modelix artifacts from GitHub packages rather than the itemis nexus server. Most packages are also published to GitHub packages for which a GithHub account and credentials are required. To access GitHub packaged you need to specify your credentials. First of all you will need to generate a personal access token with access to GitHub Packages. The project assumes that your username is available as the variable gpr.user and the token as gpr.key. The easiest way to configure the credentials is copy the example below, paste it into the gradle.properties file in the repository and replace the values with your credentials: gpr.user= gpr.key= Gradle also supports other locations for specifying these properties.","title":"Welcome to modelix.core!","component":"modelix","version":"23.1","name":"index","url":"/modelix/23.1/core/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":2},{"text":"Build components using Gradle","hash":"_build_components_using_gradle","id":3},{"text":"Build from console","hash":"_build_from_console","id":4},{"text":"IntelliJ Idea","hash":"_intellij_idea","id":5},{"text":"modelix Artifact Publication","hash":"_modelix_artifact_publication","id":6},{"text":"How to set up GitHub packages authentication","hash":"_how_to_set_up_github_packages_authentication","id":7}]},"78":{"id":78,"text":"TODO","title":"modelix.core Explanation","component":"modelix","version":"23.1","name":"index","url":"/modelix/23.1/core/explanation/index.html","titles":[]},"79":{"id":79,"text":"TODO","title":"modelix.core How-To","component":"modelix","version":"23.1","name":"index","url":"/modelix/23.1/core/howto/index.html","titles":[]},"80":{"id":80,"text":"If you are interested in a more practical usage of what is presented here, check out the samples project Creating an instance that loads the entire model from the server can be done like this: val client = LightModelClient.builder() .url(\"ws://localhost/json/v2/test-repo/ws\") // optional, by default it connects to the MPS plugin .build() You have to set a model query using changeQuery() to tell the server in what data you are interested in.

doc | Repository | buildfile | Artifacts: Nexus GitHub Packages The model-api-gen.gradle.plugin is a Gradle plugin that wraps the functionality of the MPS solution for metamodel-export and Model API Generator. It provides an additional Gradle task which will apply a 2-staged process: MPS metamodel export to JSON (optional) In the first step the metamodel-export MPS solution is executed by the plugin to export the MPS structure aspect (i.e. the metamodel) to JSON files. In case your metamodel comes from another source this is an external entry point: As long as you can export your metamodel to JSON, you can use model-api-gen. To use JSON from another source or JSON files from a previous export, you can skip this step by simply specifying a directory, which contains the JSON files, in the configuration of the gradle task: metamodel { //... jsonDir = File(\"path/to/json/dir\") } As a result, all MPS-specific configuration settings will be ignored and the specified directory will be used for the next step. JSON to model API generation In the second step, the previously generated JSON files containing the metamodel are being used to generate the typed API using the Kotlin/TypeScript generator in model-api-gen. Inside of the metamodel block the following settings can be configured. setting type description javaExecutable File Location of the Java executable moduleFolders ArrayList Directories, that contain the language modules mpsHome File Home directory of MPS mpsHeapSize String MPS heap size specified as a String, e.g. \"2g\" for 2GB includedLanguages Set Set of languages, for which an API should be generated includedLanguageNamespaces Set Set of language namespaces, for which an API should be generated includedConcepts Set Set of concepts, for which an API should be generated includedModules Set Set of modules, for which an API should be generated jsonDir File Directory containing JSON files, which represent a metamodel.

Bringing models to the cloud requires an alternative to the file system (and git) based storage of models. Modelix implements a data structure that allows replication between all MPS instances connected to the same model-server. It is very similar to the git storage format, but instead of files it stores nodes in its key-value data store. To support real-time collaboration, in addition to the snapshot of a version, the model-server also stores the operations that were applied on the previous version to produce the new version. Conflicts between concurrent modification are resolved using operational transformation (OT). The usually hard part of OT is to guarantee convergence, meaning that all clients end up with the same result independent of the order in which they receive changes. This problem becomes trivial, because versions are identified by a hash over all the content. Any divergence will result in a different hash which can easily be detected. The remaining problem is what to do when a divergence is detected. From git we know that switching between versions is fast, because it only has to apply the difference between these versions. The same is true here: Fixing a divergence is as easy as switching to the correct version. If a client does not have any local changes it does not even need to apply the change operations itself - it can just switch to the new version. So in the rare case of a divergence fixing it is nothing special and is an operation that happens all the time. While this component is independent of MPS, it is possible to replicates the data of the MPS internal module repository into a running model-server. This can be achieved using the modelix MPS plugin: One can connect an MPS instances to a model-server, upload the current module repository, and keep it synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor - both options are supported at the same time.

MPS is running in headless mode on the server with an HTTP server installed as a plugin. The browser connects to that server and receives the HTML and JavaScript code required for the interactive model editor. A second plugin connects to a model-server and replicates the data into MPS’ internal module repository. All MPS instances connected to that model server will stay synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor. Both options are supported at the same time. The next image gives an overview over the different docker images running in the kubernetes cluster. The model server uses an Apache Ignite cluster and just provides a REST API on top of it. A high load can be distributed over multiple instances. Running multiple MPS instances for scalability is possible, because the model has the same state on all instances. If you want to run MPS instances with different configurations (languages, plugins) or allow external instances to connect to the model server, a reverse proxy is used to forward the request to the correct instance. To access the web editor a user has to login in with a google account first. An OAuth proxy takes care of that and adds an HTTP header with the users e-mail address to the request. modelix provides an editor in the browser for the languages implemented in MPS. This can be an image based editor that renders the editor in MPS using the default editor definition or an HTML based editor that requires a separate editor definition in a language provided by modelix. Common to both approaches is that the user input (keyboard, mouse) is processed on the server and the update of the projection after a model change also happens on the server. Even in case of the HTML based editor the resulting HTML is computed on the server side. This removes the need to replicate the model into the browser, which would result in a bad performance in case of big models.

Modelix is a platform to bring models to the web. It consists of multiple components, which can be combined in different ways to support a variety of use cases. It is important to note, that modelix is neither a language workbench in the traditional sense nor a one-size-fits-all solution. The modelix project aims to provide you with building blocks, which empower you to construct your own application with ease. The following table gives an overview over essential components, which you are very likely to encounter when using modelix. For a full list of components check out the components table. Component Short description model-api Untyped API, which allows to interact with models. model-server Server, which persistently stores models. model-client Client, which implements the model-api and connects to a model-server. model-api-gen(-gradle) Component, which generates a typed, domain specific API based on a metamodel definition. The generated API wraps the untyped model-api. As a basic example, you might want to create a web app, which manipulates domain-specific models. In this case we assume a metamodel for such models exists as part of an MPS project. The image above shows how the essential components work together to form the backend for a web application. In this case the metamodel definition is generated from the structure aspect of a language in MPS. For a different use case it could also be from another (custom) source. The web application can then use the domain-specific API to manipulate and store models in the model-server. Of course, this example only scratches the surface of what is possible with modelix. Apart from the individual components, modelix can also provide a system called workspaces. It consists of multiple docker images, which run in a kubernetes cluster. Among other features, this system enables users to use projectional editors inside their browser by running MPS instances in the cloud. Modelix is always evolving.

We are dedicated to bring an updated version during December 2023 after our already scheduled planning sessions. Please check the documentation in the main branch of modelix. The following image shows a dense overview of our current roadmap. The aim of this roadmap is to provide you with a more detailed overview of our plans. We have compiled a catalog of our significant areas, which are our top priorities we focus on delivering. In the following we shortly list these key priorities. Below you can find more detailed explanations for each of these. Model APIs: A unified low-level API to navigate and modify models. It is untyped to any existing meta-model. Domain-Specific Model API generator: A complete rewrite of our initial API generator which overcomes multiple previous shortcomings. It provides type information and directly integrates with the model API. Versioning / Releases / Roadmap: Automated semantic versioning with unifying modelix platform releases twice a year. Development is planned over at issues.modelix.org. Documentation: Docs-as-code approach which is built to docs.modelix.org with every platform release. Git integration: A tighter integration for git based model storage to bridge legacy storage solutions. MPS in the Cloud: Run MPS in the cloud as a way to transition to the web. Language Evolution: A way to handle new language versions and metamodel changes. Graphical Editors: We plan to provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API to enable graphical editors on the wev. LIonWeb: Integration with other web components out there - modelix support and involvement in the LIonWeb (Language interfaces on the web) initiative. Several modelix artifacts had potentially confusing names. We streamlined everything and renamed to convey functionality more clearly. Check out our blog post for details. Also check the new table of modelix component overview here. Modelix uses a low level meta-model agnostic API across all components. The model-api provides this abstraction. This API is the shared basis and used across all modelix components. It is a Kotlin multi-platform implementation with artifacts for JVM and JS. An untyped access to model content is possible when only using the model-api. In case you want to use typed access, the model-api-gen provides a generator which generates a typed model API from your existing domain-specific meta-model. This generated API specializes the untyped model-api and provides domain grounded model access. Up to now, the model API generator api-gen was used to generate a domain-specific Java model API from a MPS structure. These classes can then be used in web applications to obtain typed model content from the model-server. The api-gen was implemented as a MPS generator and consequently bound to and limited by the MPS ecosystem. To overcome the many shortcomings we observed (runtime & resource usage, tool lock-in, maintainability, few target languages). We re-implement the generator (now model-api-gen`) in Kotlin, which has several benefits. Most notably, there is now an additional option to generate a domain-specific TypeScript API. One extra feature we add is MPS meta-model independence: In a new intermediate step, we export the MPS structure to a JSON representation re-using the JSON language of the existing MPS extensions. This intermediate artifact is then used by the api-gen v2 to generate the APIs. The MPS structure to JSON generator is available for all MPS versions so that previous maintenance of the api-gen v1 for multiple MPS versions is not necessary any more. To ease the use of the new model-api-gen, we provide a Gradle plugin to help setting up the domain-specific API generation: model-api-gen-gradle. With many modelix components being in various development stages - from stable to early and conceptual - they are released individually. Generally, modelix follows the Semantic Versioning scheme for releases and groups different components by repository (e.g. core components are in modelix.core, while documentation resides in modelix.docs). However, anything based on JetBrains MPS (e.g. MPS plugins or extensions) is prefixed with the corresponding MPS major and minor version number followed by our own patch version number. For example, the org.modelix.mps-model-plugin version 2021.2.103 is the 103rd release which is compatible with MPS 2021.2. To make it easier for developers, the modelix platform will be released twice a year as a single modelix platform release which aggregates all compatible component versions. We aim to provide a Spring release (modelix-2X.1) and an Autumn release (modelix-2X.2). All development in-between is carried out as patches on the releases. This release cycle starts from 2023 with the first release on the MPS Community meetup in May: modelix-23.1. For the different MPS versions there are sub-platforms that also bundle the corresponding MPS plugins of the modelix platform. The artifacts which hold the Gradle platform thus will be org.modelix.platform` org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-2 org.modelix.platform-mps-2020-3 org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-1 org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-3 Additionally, we want to communicate our plans for the modelix platform more clearly. As a result we prepared a roadmap outlining our planned steps. Further, on issues.modelix.org we also give more insights in our development efforts. To further reduce the barrier of entry to modelix with modelix-23.1 we deploy new documentation following the docs-as-code approach. You can access the new documentation over at docs.modelix.org which is available for each modelix platform release. We follow the Diataxis documentation framework to separate and communicate more clearly in the categories of Tutorials, How To Guides, Explanation, and (technical) Reference. Additionally api.modelix.org provides a generated technical API reference which we grow incrementally. Generally, we recommend using the model-server as the storage backend for models in the cloud. However, in some environments and use cases, this philosophy can only partially be archived. In rare cases we observe a hybrid setup where a) model knowledge is stored in files as MPS projects in combination with git while b) deploying web and cloud centric applications using the model-server. In a first iteration, we want to provide the possibility for read and write of MPS models from and to git repositories in the modelix platform. This could eventually also include the usage of the model-server for real-time collaboration in these hybrid setups. However, this is a topic which requires further investigation. For many MPS based projects, a good first step for transitioning to the web is running MPS in the cloud. modelix already has elaborate prototypes for these use-cases by using Kubernetes and Projector to provide MPS “Workspaces” in the cloud. One central piece for this are the modelix build-tools. This component allows the generation of MPS languages without any existing build script. We want to refine our efforts regarding MPS in the cloud and make them more accessible. When using MPS, model migrations are made easy using the migration aspect. However, once stepping outside of MPS, migrations become more difficult. Model migration needs to be carried out across platforms, teams and (web) applications when a new language version is deployed. We want to support a generated APIs that can work with multiple versions at the same time with which we also can support meta-model versions checks for compatibility. We have some ideas we need to further refine and explore in the following releases. The experience from MPS shows that the requirements for a graphical editor are too diverse to support all of them with a single framework. There are many different frameworks available in the web world where you can choose the one that fits your use case. We plan to only provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API, but not the integration of any diagram framework itself. Modelix focuses on a good integration with MPS. If you are interested in the integration of other modeling technologies then check out the LIonWeb project (short for Language Interfaces on the web). They specify more general interfaces and use the modelix model-server for data storage and exchange in their current prototypes. The modelix team co-authored and is involved with the LIonWeb initiative.","title":"Roadmap","component":"modelix","version":"23.2","name":"roadmap","url":"/modelix/23.2/main/roadmap.html","titles":[{"text":"Key priorities overview","hash":"_key_priorities_overview","id":1},{"text":"Component Renaming (23.1)","hash":"_component_renaming_23_1","id":2},{"text":"Model APIs (23.1)","hash":"_model_apis_23_1","id":3},{"text":"Domain-Specific Model API Generator (23.1)","hash":"_domain_specific_model_api_generator_23_1","id":4},{"text":"Versioning / Releases / Roadmap (23.1)","hash":"_versioning_releases_roadmap_23_1","id":5},{"text":"Documentation (23.1)","hash":"_documentation_23_1","id":6},{"text":"Git Integration (estimated 23.2)","hash":"_git_integration_estimated_23_2","id":7},{"text":"MPS in the Cloud (estimated 23.2)","hash":"_mps_in_the_cloud_estimated_23_2","id":8},{"text":"Language Evolution (estimated 24.1)","hash":"_language_evolution_estimated_24_1","id":9},{"text":"Graphical Editors in the Web (estimated 24.2)","hash":"_graphical_editors_in_the_web_estimated_24_2","id":10},{"text":"LIonWeb","hash":"_lionweb","id":11}]},"104":{"id":104,"text":"This page represents a fallback page for open TODOs within the documentation.

Each use case uses different components from the modelix platform to create custom solutions. On this page, you can get an overview of all use cases, and see how they are related and what their essential differences are. In the first use case, an MPS project is synchronized to a repository on a model server by utilizing the model-server-sync-plugin. It shows how to make model data, previously accessible only in a running MPS or via files, available through a server. In itself, this use case has little value, but the next use cases build in part on it. See the Use case 1 page for details. In this use case, we connect web frontends to a model server. The web frontends read from and write model data to the model server. One web frontend can be used to edit model data and is implemented with Vue.js. The other one serves as an overview and is implemented with Angular. You can see how changes made in one connected application are instantly reflected in another connected application. You can also connect an MPS to the model server and see how changes made in the application are synced to MPS and vice versa. The frontend applications directly use the model-client JavaScript library that connects to the model server. They also use a TypeScript API generated by the Model API generator from the metamodel to enable type-safe access to data structures provided by the model client. See the Use case 2 page for details. In this use case, a web frontend connects to a web backend, which in turn communicates with a model server. Like in use case 2 model data is synced automatically between the model server, the application and MPS. A backend is needed if you need to control what data a client might read and write. It is also useful to translate data from modelix data structures into a data structure that is suitable for your web applications. The web backend is implemented with Quarkus. It uses the model-client to connect to a model server. It also uses a Kotlin API generated by the Model API generator from the metamodel to enable type-safe access to data structures provided by the model client. For the Angular based web frontend, the web backend provides a custom HTTP- and websocket-based API.

While the data structure for model replication in Modelix supports partial loading of models, you still need a way to describe which data you need on the client. Loading data on demand while traversing the model also results in a poor performance, because of the potentially large number of fine-grained request. A first attempt to solve this problem was to disallow lazy loading and require the client to load all required data at the beginning, before working with the model. A special query language was used to filter the data and an attempt to access a node that is not included by that query resulted in an exception, forcing the developer to adjust the query. While this results in a more predictable performance, it is also hard to maintain and still not optimal for the performance. You have to download all the data at the beginning that you might eventually need, potentially exceeding the available memory of the system. The ModelQL query language provides a more dynamic way of loading parts of the model on demand, but still allows reducing the number of request to a minimum. The downside is that it’s not just a different implementation hidden behind the model-api, but requires to use a different API. The query language is inspired by Reactive Streams and the execution engine uses Kotlin Flows, which is a Coroutines compatible implementation of Reactive Streams. Often it’s useful to know if a stream is expected to return only one element or multiple elements. Project Reactor, another implementation of Reactive Streams, introduced the notion of Mono and Flux to distinguish them. You will also find them in ModelQL.","title":"ModelQL","component":"modelix","version":"23.2","name":"modelql","url":"/modelix/23.2/core/explanation/modelql.html","titles":[{"text":"Reactive Streams","hash":"_reactive_streams","id":1}]},"119":{"id":119,"text":"TODO","title":"modelix.core How-To","component":"modelix","version":"23.2","name":"index","url":"/modelix/23.2/core/howto/index.html","titles":[]},"120":{"id":120,"text":"ModelQL defines its own HTTP endpoint and provides server/client implementations for it. The model-server and the mps-model-server-plugin already implement this endpoint. The client can be created like this: val client = ModelQLClient.builder().url(\"http://localhost/query\").httpClient(httpClient).build() val result: List = client.query { root -> root.children(\"modules\").property(\"name\").toList() } When creating a LightModelClient you can optionally provide a ModelQLClient instance, which allows invoking .query { …​ } (see below) on a node returned by the LightModelClient. val modelqlClient = ModelQLClient.builder().build() val client = LightModelClient.builder().modelQLClient(modelqlClient).build() val result: List = client.getRootNode()!!.query { it.children(\"modules\").property(\"name\").toList() } You can use the model-api-gen-gradle plugin to generate type safe extensions from your meta-model. Specify the modelqlKotlinDir property to enable the generation. val result: List = client.query { root -> root.children(\"classes\").ofConcept(C_ClassConcept) .member .ofConcept(C_StaticMethodDeclaration) .filter { it.visibility.instanceOf(C_PublicVisibility) } .toList() } If a query returns a node, you can execute a new query starting from that node. val cls: ClassConcept = client.query { it.children(\"classes\").ofConcept(C_ClassConcept).first() } val names = cls.query { it.member.ofConcept(C_StaticMethodDeclaration).name.toList() } For convenience, it’s possible to access further data of that node using the INode API, but this is not recommended though, because each access sends a new query to the server. val cls: ClassConcept = client.query { it.children(\"classes\").ofConcept(C_ClassConcept).first() } val className = cls.name While returning a list of elements is simple, the purpose of the query language is to reduce the number of request to a minimum. This requires combining multiple values into more complex data structures. The zip operation provides a simple way of doing that: val result: List>> = query { db -> db.products.map { val id = it.id val title = it.title val images = it.images.toList() id.zip(title, images) }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.first}, Title: ${it.second}, Images: ${it.third}\") } This is suitable for combining a small number of values, but because of the missing variable names it can be hard to read for a larger number of values or even multiple zip operations assembled into a hierarchical data structure. This can be solved by defining custom data classes and using the mapLocal operation: data class MyProduct(val id: Int, val title: String, val images: List) data class MyImage(val url: String) val result: List = remoteProductDatabaseQuery { db -> db.products.map { val id = it.id val title = it.title val images = it.images.mapLocal { MyImage(it) }.toList() id.zip(title, images).mapLocal { MyProduct(it.first, it.second, it.third) } }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.id}, Title: ${it.title}, Images: ${it.images}\") } The mapLocal operation is not just useful in combination with the zip operation, but in general to create instances of classes only known to the client. The body of mapLocal is executed on the client after receiving the result from the server. That’s why you only have access to the output of the zip operation and still have to use first, second and third inside the query. To make this even more readable there is a buildLocalMapping operation, which provides a different syntax for the zip-mapLocal chain. data class MyProduct(val id: Int, val title: String, val images: List) data class MyImage(val url: String) val result: List = query { db -> db.products.buildLocalMapping { val id = it.id.request() val title = it.title.request() val images = it.images.mapLocal { MyImage(it) }.toList().request() onSuccess { MyProduct(id.get(), title.get(), images.get()) } }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.id}, Title: ${it.title}, Images: ${it.images}\") } At the beginning of the buildLocalMapping body, you invoke request() on all the values you need to assemble your object. This basically adds the operand to the internal zip operation and returns an object that gives you access to the value after receiving it from the server. Inside the onSuccess block you assemble the local object using the previously requested values. One use case of the query language is to build database applications that generate HTML pages from the data stored in the model server. You can use the Kotlin HTML DSL together with ModelQL to do that. Use buildHtmlQuery to request data from the server and render it into an HTML string: val html = query { it.map(buildHtmlQuery { val modules = input.children(\"modules\").requestFragment { val moduleName = input.property(\"name\").request() val models = input.children(\"models\").requestFragment { val modelName = input.property(\"name\").request() onSuccess { div { h2 { +\"Model: ${modelName.get()}\" } } } } onSuccess { div { h1 { +\"Module: ${moduleName.get()}\" } insertFragment(models) } } } onSuccess { body { insertFragment(modules) } } }) } buildHtmlQuery and the requestFragment operation are similar to the buildLocalMapping operation, but inside the onSuccess block you use the Kotlin HTML DSL.","title":"ModelQL","component":"modelix","version":"23.2","name":"modelql","url":"/modelix/23.2/core/howto/modelql.html","titles":[{"text":"Independent ModelQLClient","hash":"_independent_modelqlclient","id":1},{"text":"Integration with LightModelClient","hash":"_integration_with_lightmodelclient","id":2},{"text":"Type-safe ModelQL API","hash":"_type_safe_modelql_api","id":3},{"text":"Run query on an INode","hash":"_run_query_on_an_inode","id":4},{"text":"Complex query results","hash":"_complex_query_results","id":5},{"text":"Kotlin HTML integration","hash":"_kotlin_html_integration","id":6}]},"121":{"id":121,"text":"If you want to test code that processes model-api instances, you can do this in-process without a running (light-) model-server.

Generator. It provides an additional Gradle task which will apply a 2-staged process: MPS metamodel export to JSON (optional) In the first step the metamodel-export MPS solution is executed by the plugin to export the MPS structure aspect (i.e. the metamodel) to JSON files. In case your metamodel comes from another source this is an external entry point: As long as you can export your metamodel to JSON, you can use model-api-gen. To use JSON from another source or JSON files from a previous export, you can skip this step by simply specifying a directory, which contains the JSON files, in the configuration of the gradle task: metamodel { //... jsonDir = File(\"path/to/json/dir\") } As a result, all MPS-specific configuration settings will be ignored and the specified directory will be used for the next step.

Bringing models to the cloud requires an alternative to the file system (and git) based storage of models. Modelix implements a data structure that allows replication between all MPS instances connected to the same model-server. It is very similar to the git storage format, but instead of files it stores nodes in its key-value data store. To support real-time collaboration, in addition to the snapshot of a version, the model-server also stores the operations that were applied on the previous version to produce the new version. Conflicts between concurrent modification are resolved using operational transformation (OT). The usually hard part of OT is to guarantee convergence, meaning that all clients end up with the same result independent of the order in which they receive changes. This problem becomes trivial, because versions are identified by a hash over all the content. Any divergence will result in a different hash which can easily be detected. The remaining problem is what to do when a divergence is detected. From git we know that switching between versions is fast, because it only has to apply the difference between these versions. The same is true here: Fixing a divergence is as easy as switching to the correct version. If a client does not have any local changes it does not even need to apply the change operations itself - it can just switch to the new version. So in the rare case of a divergence fixing it is nothing special and is an operation that happens all the time. While this component is independent of MPS, it is possible to replicates the data of the MPS internal module repository into a running model-server. This can be achieved using the modelix MPS plugin: One can connect an MPS instances to a model-server, upload the current module repository, and keep it synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor - both options are supported at the same time. To reformat and add license header to all files run: ../gradlew spotlessApply Valid keys are keys starting with the PROTECTED_PREFIX ($$$).

Consequently, opening any repository with IntelliJ will also allow you to build and eventually contribute.

As a consequence, when you build modelix or use modelix components via Gradle there is no repository access setup required. This is optional when you want to obtain modelix artifacts from GitHub packages rather than the itemis nexus server. Most packages are also published to GitHub packages for which a GithHub account and credentials are required. To access GitHub packaged you need to specify your credentials. First of all you will need to generate a personal access token with access to GitHub Packages. The project assumes that your username is available as the variable gpr.user and the token as gpr.key.

For example: dependencies { implementation(enforcedPlatform(\"org.modelix:platform-mps-$mps_version:$modelix_platform_version\")) implementation(\"org.modelix:model-client\") } If you want to handle dependencies to MPS version-specific modelix components yourself, you can use org.modelix:platform instead, which does not contain these dependencies.
