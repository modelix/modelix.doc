develop an open source platform for models on the web to reduce distributed modeling friction for domain experts We apply established web and cloud technologies to create a modeling tool in the browser which integrates with existing language workbenches whilst exploring new approaches The modelix project develops an open source platform for (meta-)models on the web. We are native to the web and the cloud, inspired by this whitepaper[1]. On the path to this final idea, we currently develop multiple interoperable components that implement parts of our vision. Consequently, some parts are very stable and already in productive use while others are in a more experimental and explorative state. To gain an overview over components, head over to the Components of modelix reference. Follow the 'Next' button in the bottom right to find out more details on our current roadmap, or dive directly into our sample project to get started! Otherwise, the How-To section serves as an implicit FAQ which might give answers to some of your immediate questions. This is the full modelix documentation for modelix version main. You can choose different versions at the bottom left of this page. This documentation brings together the documentation from all individual modelix components. We follow the systematic Diátaxis[2] approach in this documentation. As a result, we separate the documentation in the following four mayor categories: Tutorials (learning-oriented) Lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. New users usually start here. How-To Guides Reference There is also a dedicated API page where you can find component specific API documentaion over at https://api.docs.modelix.org. Explanation This documentation is built using the Antora framework. All individual software components contain their own documentation within their own repository but are aggregated here. The playbook for aggregation and central source source for this documentation can be found in the modelix/modelix.doc repository. If you find any bugs or errors in our documentation please add pull requests or issues in the corresponding repository. In this documentation we use various acronyms and domain-specific wording. Head over to the Glossary if you are unsure about what exactly we mean when talking about a model, meta-model, MPS, or others.

MPS is running in headless mode on the server with an HTTP server installed as a plugin. The browser connects to that server and receives the HTML and JavaScript code required for the interactive model editor. A second plugin connects to a model-server and replicates the data into MPS’ internal module repository. All MPS instances connected to that model server will stay synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor. Both options are supported at the same time. The next image gives an overview over the different docker images running in the kubernetes cluster. The model server uses an Apache Ignite cluster and just provides a REST API on top of it. A high load can be distributed over multiple instances. Running multiple MPS instances for scalability is possible, because the model has the same state on all instances. If you want to run MPS instances with different configurations (languages, plugins) or allow external instances to connect to the model server, a reverse proxy is used to forward the request to the correct instance. To access the web editor a user has to login in with a google account first. An OAuth proxy takes care of that and adds an HTTP header with the users e-mail address to the request. modelix provides an editor in the browser for the languages implemented in MPS. This can be an image based editor that renders the editor in MPS using the default editor definition or an HTML based editor that requires a separate editor definition in a language provided by modelix. Common to both approaches is that the user input (keyboard, mouse) is processed on the server and the update of the projection after a model change also happens on the server. Even in case of the HTML based editor the resulting HTML is computed on the server side. This removes the need to replicate the model into the browser, which would result in a bad performance in case of big models. Running MPS in the cloud requires an alternative to the file system for storing models. modelix implements a data structure that allows replication between all MPS instances connected to the same model server. It is very similar to the git storage format, but instead of files it stores nodes in its key-value data store. To support realtime collaboration, in addition to the snapshot of a version it also stores the operations that were applied on the previous version to produce the new version. Conflicts between concurrent modification are resolved using operational transformation (OT). The usually hard part of OT is to guarantee convergence, meaning that all clients end up with the same result indepent of the order in which they receive changes. This problem becomes trivial, because versions are identified by a hash over all the content. Any divergence will result in a different hash which can easily be detected. The remaining problem is what to do when a divergence is detected. From git we know that switching between versions is fast, because it only has to apply the difference between these versions. The same is true here. Fixing a divergence is as easy as switching to the correct version. If a client doesn’t have any local changes it doesn’t even need to apply the change operations itself. It can just switch to the new version. So in the rare case of a divergence fixing it is nothing special.

Modelix is a platform to bring models to the web. It consists of multiple components, which can be combined in different ways to support a variety of use cases. It is important to note, that modelix is neither a language workbench in the traditional sense nor a one-size-fits-all solution. The modelix project aims to provide you with building blocks, which empower you to construct your own application with ease. The following table gives an overview over essential components, which you are very likely to encounter when using modelix. For a full list of components check out the components table. Component Short description model-api Untyped API, which allows to interact with models. model-server Server, which persistently stores models. model-client Client, which implements the model-api and connects to a model-server. model-api-gen(-gradle) Component, which generates a typed, domain specific API based on a metamodel definition. The generated API wraps the untyped model-api. As a basic example, you might want to create a web app, which manipulates domain-specific models. In this case we assume a metamodel for such models exists as part of an MPS project. The image above shows how the essential components work together to form the backend for a web application. In this case the metamodel definition is generated from the structure aspect of a language in MPS. For a different use case it could also be from another (custom) source. The web application can then use the domain-specific API to manipulate and store models in the model-server. Of course, this example only scratches the surface of what is possible with modelix. Apart from the individual components, modelix can also provide a system called workspaces. It consists of multiple docker images, which run in a kubernetes cluster. Among other features, this system enables users to use projectional editors inside their browser by running MPS instances in the cloud. Modelix is always evolving. If you want to learn more about what is coming, check out the roadmap.","title":"Modelix Overview","component":"modelix","version":"main","name":"overview","url":"/modelix/main/explanation/overview.html","titles":[{"text":"What is Modelix?","hash":"_what_is_modelix","id":1},{"text":"Essential components","hash":"_essential_components","id":2},{"text":"Basic example using essential components","hash":"_basic_example_using_essential_components","id":3},{"text":"Modelix workspaces","hash":"_modelix_workspaces","id":4},{"text":"What’s next","hash":"_whats_next","id":5}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"TODO","title":"Frequently asked Questions","component":"modelix","version":"main","name":"faq","url":"/modelix/main/howto/faq.html","titles":[]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"\"How-to guides are directions that take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem.

We use Semantic Versioning in modelix.core (a further rollout to the other modelix repositories is planned for the future). Therefore, commit messages follow Conventional Commits. To install the hooks enforcing the convention, you need to run npm install and pre-commit install in your local repository. Branch names should always be prefixed. The prefix is determined by the type of changes that your branch provides like fix/, feature/, docs/. Alternatively you can use issue/ followed by the issue id as your branch name, e.g. issue/MODELIX-123.

We deploy all relevant artifacts to the itemis Nexus server as well as GitHub Packages Issues are managed in our issue tracker over at https://issues.modelix.org. With many components being in various development stages - from stable to early and conceptual - they are released individually for each repository. Generally, we follow the Semantic versioning scheme for releases. However, anything based on JetBrains MPS (e.g. MPS plugins or extensions) are prefixed with the corresponding MPS major and minor version number followed by our own patch version number. For example, the org.modelix.mps-model-plugin version 2021.2.103 is the 103rd release which is compatible with MPS 2021.2.*. To make it easier for developers, the modelix platform is currently released twice a year as a single \"platform release\" which references compatible component versions. We aim to provide a Spring release (e.g. 24.1) and an Autumn release (e.g. 24.2). All development in-between is carried out as patches on the releases. This release cycle starts from 2023 with the first release during the 'MPS Community Meetup' in May: 2023.R1. To gain an overview over existing components, please refer to the list of components here. Our roadmap outlines the current goals on our agenda for modelix. Sometimes we want to implement a feature or expose an API that is experimental. When doing so, we mark the APIs as experimental. In TypeScript, we use the documentation tag @experimental. For Kotlin, we use the annotation @UnstableModelixFeature for an opt-in requirement When marking something as experimental, we document the reason for it being experimental and our plans for stabilizing the feature.

The aim of this roadmap is to provide you with a more detailed overview of our plans. We have compiled a catalog of our significant areas, which are our top priorities we focus on delivering. In the following we shortly list these key priorities. Below you can find more detailed explanations for each of these. ModelQL: Dynamic query language for on-demand loading overcoming issues associated with upfront data retrieval and optimizing performance MPS 2023 / 2024 Support: Provide support in modelix for newer MPS versions LIonWeb (estimated 24.1): Integration with other web components via a new LionWeb bulk API adapter Model-server services: Streamlined interfaces and structure for services[1] Meta-model in model-server: A way to store the meta-model of corresponding model content in the model-server (foundation for language evolution). GraphQL interface: An endpoint for smaller web applications, leveraging the available tooling ecosystem Projectional text editors in browser: Projectional text editors for browsers, using Kotlin multiplatform to edit models directly or through server-side rendering Graphical Editors: We plan to provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API to enable graphical editors on the web. With the modelix 23.2 release we introduced ModelQL: A dynamic way of loading and writing parts of the model on demand while reducing the number of requests to a minimum. To learn more, head over to the ModelQL documentation and the corresponding How-Tos. While the early version allowed us to provide a quick win for large models, we were not able to finish this feature fully. Especially writing support currently needs to be stabilized and performance can be improved. We also want to integrate ModelQL in our samples project to present a graspable example beyond the documentation. In a larger effort to become MPS version independent, we prepare our plugins and interfaces with MPS to provide preliminary support for MPS 2023 for the modelix 24.1 release. This effort is needed to provide adequate support today, but in the following release 24.2 we plan to fully transition away from dedicated MPS plugins over to IntelliJ Platform plugins. IntelliJ Platform plugins do not require to be written in MPS and are allowed to be created using Kotlin - just like everything else in modelix. All MPS interfacing parts will use the comparably stable APIs provided by MPS to query and modify MPS models, such as the Open API and the SModel. As a result, we do not have to migrate and maintain MPS plugins for multiple MPS versions at the same time. Instead, we have a single Kotlin codebase which can provide the same functionality to all MPS versions. This effort will reduce complexity and potential for bugs and allow us to better test and validate our MPS interfacing plugins. Modelix focuses on a good integration with MPS. But if you are interested in the integration of other modeling technologies then check out the LIonWeb project (short for Language Interfaces on the web). They specify more general interfaces and use the modelix model-server for data storage and exchange in their current prototypes. For 24.1 we want to provide an adapter for the modelix model-server to support the initial LionWeb bulk protocol for model data storage and retrieval. The modelix team co-authored and is involved with the LIonWeb initiative. Modelix already allows you to access model data from any web application, either untyped (i.e. on the M3 layer), or typed (i.e. on the M2 layer or domain layer). As soon as you have model content in a web application the question regarding correct scoping, typing, and other checks arises. In MPS we grew accustomed to easy integration of these different language aspects. In modelix we envision model-server services to do this type of model analysis, checking, and eventually transformation. In fact, this can already be done today: Any application accessing model data from a model-server can provide external APIs for the above-mentioned features. However, we plan to streamline interfaces and approaches used by services to communicate with the model-server. Our goal is to provide a stable basis for services which will encourage re-use and extension. When using MPS, model migrations are made easy using the migration aspect. However, once stepping outside of MPS, migrations may become more difficult. Model migration needs to be carried out across platforms, teams and (web) applications when a new language version is deployed. We want to support a generated API that can work with multiple versions at the same time with which we also can support meta-model versions checks for compatibility. As a consequence, we will need meta-model information in the model-server and plan to add this as a foundation for Language Evolution. Until now, there was no need for this knowledge to be available directly but technically the meta-model is already stored, though implicitly encoded in the storage, but the model-server does not use or interpret this knowledge. We have some ideas we need to further refine and explore in the following releases. As with all other parts of modelix, we prefer using established and state-of-the-art tools. Consequently, for smaller web applications we consider to provide a simple GraphQL endpoint, which can provide immediate benefit. Especially the access to a powerful tooling ecosystem with GUIs, editor integrations, code generation, linting, analytics, and more is a direct win. However, it is important to note, that this approach will not scale: As soon as the model size grows or the strong integration requirements exist, other tools such as our ModelQL or the model-server services are needed. Similar to our previously developed notation language prototype (based on the old shadow models), we want to provide generic projectional text editors in the browser. A default notation is used for concepts without a web specific notation, just as MPS does it. We envision projectional text editor components implemented in Kotlin multiplatform for editing models in the browser, either directly or via server-side rendering. The experience from MPS shows that the requirements for a graphical editor are too diverse to support all of them with a single framework. There are many different frameworks available in the web world where you can choose the one that fits your use case. We plan to only provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API, but not the integration of any diagram framework itself. 1. We understand a service in this context as model-server independent software which operates on model data to provide some sort of derived knowledge. Within the modelix architecture, it does not matter if services run client or server sided, but we want to ensure that services are independent components which have to define their own endpoints and interfaces to the outside. We envision services to provide model validation, checking, transformation, or any other model data modification - features which language workbenches tightly integrate, for example in MPS aspects.","title":"Roadmap","component":"modelix","version":"main","name":"roadmap","url":"/modelix/main/main/roadmap.html","titles":[{"text":"Key priorities overview","hash":"_key_priorities_overview","id":1},{"text":"ModelQL (estimated 24.1)","hash":"modelql","id":2},{"text":"MPS 2023 / 2024 Support (estimated 24.1)","hash":"_mps_2023_2024_support_estimated_24_1","id":3},{"text":"LIonWeb (estimated 24.1)","hash":"_lionweb_estimated_24_1","id":4},{"text":"Model-server services (estimated 24.2)","hash":"services","id":5},{"text":"Meta-model in model-server (estimated 24.2)","hash":"_meta_model_in_model_server_estimated_24_2","id":6},{"text":"GraphQL interface (estimated 25.1)","hash":"_graphql_interface_estimated_25_1","id":7},{"text":"Projectional text editors in browser (estimated 25.1)","hash":"_projectional_text_editors_in_browser_estimated_25_1","id":8},{"text":"Graphical Editors in the Web (estimated 25.2)","hash":"_graphical_editors_in_the_web_estimated_25_2","id":9}]},"12":{"id":12,"text":"This page represents a fallback page for open TODOs within the documentation.

Each use case uses different components from the modelix platform to create custom solutions. On this page, you can get an overview of all use cases, and see how they are related and what their essential differences are. In the first use case, an MPS project is synchronized to a repository on a model server by utilizing the model-server-sync-plugin. It shows how to make model data, previously accessible only in a running MPS or via files, available through a server. In itself, this use case has little value, but the next use cases build in part on it. See the Use case 1 page for details. In this use case, we connect web frontends to a model server. The web frontends read from and write model data to the model server. One web frontend can be used to edit model data and is implemented with Vue.js. The other one serves as an overview and is implemented with Angular. You can see how changes made in one connected application are instantly reflected in another connected application. You can also connect an MPS to the model server and see how changes made in the application are synced to MPS and vice versa. The frontend applications directly use the model-client JavaScript library that connects to the model server. They also use a TypeScript API generated by the Model API generator from the metamodel to enable type-safe access to data structures provided by the model client. See the Use case 2 page for details. In this use case, a web frontend connects to a web backend, which in turn communicates with a model server. Like in use case 2 model data is synced automatically between the model server, the application and MPS. A backend is needed if you need to control what data a client might read and write. It is also useful to translate data from modelix data structures into a data structure that is suitable for your web applications. The web backend is implemented with Quarkus. It uses the model-client to connect to a model server. It also uses a Kotlin API generated by the Model API generator from the metamodel to enable type-safe access to data structures provided by the model client. For the Angular based web frontend, the web backend provides a custom HTTP- and websocket-based API. See the Use case 3 page for details. This is not strictly a use case but rather a bonus to increase the transparency and visibility of the requests happening in the background. The model-server always provides a /metrics endpoint which allows you to obtain data on several inner workings, such as HTTP connections or JVM statistics. As soon as you start a model-server, you can thus run a dedicated monitoring database (e.g. Prometheus) and a dashboard (e.g. Grafana) to obtain and visualize metrics respectively.

It displays an overview of model data. It also uses the model-client and the generated type-safe TypeScript API. A running MPS projects syncs model data using the model-server-sync-plugin. The web frontends communicate directly with a model server and not through an intermediary custom backend like in use case 3. Take a look at the overview to understand how this use case relates to the other use cases. Figure 1. Demonstration of synchronization Figure 2. Interactions in demonstration In this demonstration Model data is edited through the Management application. Those changes are then synced to the Overview application and MPS through the model server. Model data is edited again in MPS by reverting the made changes. Those changes are then also synced back.

This use case consists of: a model server that holds model data a web backend that can read and write data to the model server a web frontend that displays data from and interacts with the web backend an optionally running MPS that syncs its data with the model server To see how a web frontend can directly connect to a model server, take a look at use case 2. A backend is needed if you need to control what data a client might read and write. It is also useful to translate data from modelix data structures into a data structure that is suitable for your web applications. The web backend is implemented in Quarkus. It communicates to the model server using the model-client. The data communicated between the model server and web backend are modelix-specific data structures without information about the metamodel. In the backend, those data structures are wrapped with generated Kotlin classes generated by the Model API generator from the metamodel. The backend programmer can use this so-called domain-specific-language API to access model data more type-safely. The web backend exposes a custom application-specific API, which the web frontend uses to communicate and read and write data. The web backend, therefore: controls how data is read and written to the model server. hides details about modelix-specific data structures and domain-specific-language API. Figure 1. Demonstration of synchronization Figure 2. Interactions in demonstration In this demonstration Data is changed in one of the opened web frontends. These changes are first propagated to the web backend. The web backend propagates the changes to the model server. The web backend also propagates the changes to the other opened web frontend. The model server syncs the changes into MPS. Model data is edited again in MPS by reverting the made changes. Those changes are then also propagated to the model server. The model server propagates the changes to the web backend. The web backend propagates the changes to all opened web frontends. You can try the demo yourself by downloading the samples repository.

These components include among others the model-server, model-api-gen, model-api-gen-gradle, and All components in this repository have no dependencies to JetBrains MPS. The modelix project uses Gradle to build the individual components. Simply call the following in the top level folder of a repository: ./gradlew build # mac/linux or if you are on windows use: gradlew.bat build # windows Wherever possible we use the latest IntelliJ IDEA IDE to manage projects in our repositories. Consequently, opening any repository with IntelliJ will also allow you to build and eventually contribute. At the moment most modelix artifacts are stored on the itemis nexus with no access restriction. As a consequence, when you build modelix or use modelix components via Gradle there is no repository access setup required. This is optional when you want to obtain modelix artifacts from GitHub packages rather than the itemis nexus server. Most packages are also published to GitHub packages for which a GithHub account and credentials are required. To access GitHub packaged you need to specify your credentials. First of all you will need to generate a personal access token with access to GitHub Packages. The project assumes that your username is available as the variable gpr.user and the token as gpr.key. The easiest way to configure the credentials is copy the example below, paste it into the gradle.properties file in the repository and replace the values with your credentials: gpr.user= gpr.key= Gradle also supports other locations for specifying these properties.","title":"Welcome to modelix.core!","component":"modelix","version":"main","name":"index","url":"/modelix/main/core/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":2},{"text":"Build components using Gradle","hash":"_build_components_using_gradle","id":3},{"text":"Build from console","hash":"_build_from_console","id":4},{"text":"IntelliJ Idea","hash":"_intellij_idea","id":5},{"text":"modelix Artifact Publication","hash":"_modelix_artifact_publication","id":6},{"text":"How to set up GitHub packages authentication","hash":"_how_to_set_up_github_packages_authentication","id":7}]},"26":{"id":26,"text":"TODO","title":"modelix.core Explanation","component":"modelix","version":"main","name":"index","url":"/modelix/main/core/explanation/index.html","titles":[]},"27":{"id":27,"text":"When working with large models you will quickly run into performance issues when you try to replicate the whole model into the client. While the data structure for model replication in Modelix supports partial loading of models, you still need a way to describe which data you need on the client. Loading data on demand while traversing the model also results in a poor performance, because of the potentially large number of fine-grained request. A first attempt to solve this problem was to disallow lazy loading and require the client to load all required data at the beginning, before working with the model. A special query language was used to filter the data and an attempt to access a node that is not included by that query resulted in an exception, forcing the developer to adjust the query. While this results in a more predictable performance, it is also hard to maintain and still not optimal for the performance. You have to download all the data at the beginning that you might eventually need, potentially exceeding the available memory of the system. The ModelQL query language provides a more dynamic way of loading parts of the model on demand, but still allows reducing the number of request to a minimum. The downside is that it’s not just a different implementation hidden behind the model-api, but requires to use a different API. The query language is inspired by Reactive Streams and the execution engine uses Kotlin Flows, which is a Coroutines compatible implementation of Reactive Streams. Often it’s useful to know if a stream is expected to return only one element or multiple elements. Project Reactor, another implementation of Reactive Streams, introduced the notion of Mono and Flux to distinguish them. You will also find them in ModelQL.","title":"ModelQL","component":"modelix","version":"main","name":"modelql","url":"/modelix/main/core/explanation/modelql.html","titles":[{"text":"Reactive Streams","hash":"_reactive_streams","id":1}]},"28":{"id":28,"text":"TODO","title":"modelix.core How-To","component":"modelix","version":"main","name":"index","url":"/modelix/main/core/howto/index.html","titles":[]},"29":{"id":29,"text":"The model-server provides basic metrics at the HTTP endpoint /metrics.

A model server already implements this endpoint. It is recommended to use the ModelQL client integrated in to the model client V2 when working with the model server: val client = ModelClientV2.builder() .url(\"http://localhost:28101/v2\") .build() val result: List = client.query { root -> root.children(\"modules\").property(\"name\").toList() } An independent ModelQL client can be created like this: val client = ModelQLClient.builder().url(\"http://localhost/query\").httpClient(httpClient).build() val result: List = client.query { root -> root.children(\"modules\").property(\"name\").toList() } This is only useful when some custom implementation of a ModelQL server needs to be used. You can use the model-api-gen-gradle plugin to generate type safe extensions from your meta-model. Specify the modelqlKotlinDir property to enable the generation. val result: List = client.query { root -> root.children(\"classes\").ofConcept(C_ClassConcept) .member .ofConcept(C_StaticMethodDeclaration) .filter { it.visibility.instanceOf(C_PublicVisibility) } .toList() } If a query returns a node, you can execute a new query starting from that node. val cls: ClassConcept = client.query { it.children(\"classes\").ofConcept(C_ClassConcept).first() } val names = cls.query { it.member.ofConcept(C_StaticMethodDeclaration).name.toList() } For convenience, it’s possible to access further data of that node using the INode API, but this is not recommended though, because each access sends a new query to the server. val cls: ClassConcept = client.query { it.children(\"classes\").ofConcept(C_ClassConcept).first() } val className = cls.name While returning a list of elements is simple, the purpose of the query language is to reduce the number of request to a minimum. This requires combining multiple values into more complex data structures. The zip operation provides a simple way of doing that: val result: List>> = query { db -> db.products.map { val id = it.id val title = it.title val images = it.images.toList() id.zip(title, images) }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.first}, Title: ${it.second}, Images: ${it.third}\") } This is suitable for combining a small number of values, but because of the missing variable names it can be hard to read for a larger number of values or even multiple zip operations assembled into a hierarchical data structure. This can be solved by defining custom data classes and using the mapLocal operation: data class MyProduct(val id: Int, val title: String, val images: List) data class MyImage(val url: String) val result: List = remoteProductDatabaseQuery { db -> db.products.map { val id = it.id val title = it.title val images = it.images.mapLocal { MyImage(it) }.toList() id.zip(title, images).mapLocal { MyProduct(it.first, it.second, it.third) } }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.id}, Title: ${it.title}, Images: ${it.images}\") } The mapLocal operation is not just useful in combination with the zip operation, but in general to create instances of classes only known to the client. The body of mapLocal is executed on the client after receiving the result from the server. That’s why you only have access to the output of the zip operation and still have to use first, second and third inside the query. To make this even more readable there is a buildLocalMapping operation, which provides a different syntax for the zip-mapLocal chain. data class MyProduct(val id: Int, val title: String, val images: List) data class MyImage(val url: String) val result: List = query { db -> db.products.buildLocalMapping { val id = it.id.request() val title = it.title.request() val images = it.images.mapLocal { MyImage(it) }.toList().request() onSuccess { MyProduct(id.get(), title.get(), images.get()) } }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.id}, Title: ${it.title}, Images: ${it.images}\") } At the beginning of the buildLocalMapping body, you invoke request() on all the values you need to assemble your object. This basically adds the operand to the internal zip operation and returns an object that gives you access to the value after receiving it from the server. Inside the onSuccess block you assemble the local object using the previously requested values. One use case of the query language is to build database applications that generate HTML pages from the data stored in the model server. You can use the Kotlin HTML DSL together with ModelQL to do that. Use buildHtmlQuery to request data from the server and render it into an HTML string: val html = query { it.map(buildHtmlQuery { val modules = input.children(\"modules\").requestFragment { val moduleName = input.property(\"name\").request() val models = input.children(\"models\").requestFragment { val modelName = input.property(\"name\").request() onSuccess { div { h2 { +\"Model: ${modelName.get()}\" } } } } onSuccess { div { h1 { +\"Module: ${moduleName.get()}\" } insertFragment(models) } } } onSuccess { body { insertFragment(modules) } } }) } buildHtmlQuery and the requestFragment operation are similar to the buildLocalMapping operation, but inside the onSuccess block you use the Kotlin HTML DSL. To search for a node efficiently, .find can be used. Internally, it creates a map of all the elements and reuses that in following queries. val nodeId: String root.find( // Provides all nodes to index { it.descendants() }, // selects the index key for each node { it.nodeReferenceAsString() }, // The key to search for in the current request nodeId.asMono() ) It’s also possible to search for multiple nodes: val name: String root.findAll({ it.descendants().ofConcept(C_INamedConcept) }, { it.name }, name.asMono()) Internally, they both use the memoize operation. memoize stores the result of the query and reuses it without re-executing the query.

To initialize the client, we can call (we assume coroutine execution in all following code blocks): // init is a suspend fun, so we use a coroutine runBlocking(CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default).coroutineContext){ client.init() } Afterward, we create a repository and replicate it locally into a ReplicatedModel.

During development or to perform tests, it is recommended to start the model-server with in-memory storage. This can be achieved by adding the -inmemory flag to the executable. The following list gives an overview of the many ways to run a model-server: We publish a Docker container of the model-server over on Docker Hub. To run the model-server container with the in-memory backend, simply call the following. $ docker run --rm -p 28101:28101 modelix/modelix-model:latest -inmemory If you use docker-compose, use the following.

A common example would be synchronizing a local MPS project to a model-server. Figure 1. Bulk Synchronization between MPS and model-server The plugin allows the definition of sync directions inside of a modelSync block by specifying source and target endpoint. Based on these directions, Gradle tasks will be generated, which can be run to trigger the corresponding synchronization. Internally, the node data will be bulk exported from the source endpoint and stored as JSON files. After that, these JSON files serve as a specification to incrementally update the target model via the target model-api endpoint. This means that only a minimal amount of write operations is used to update the target model. method parameter type description dependsOn Any Adds the given task as a dependency of this task. direction String, Action Defines a new sync direction with the given name. method parameter type description fromLocal Action Defines a local source (MPS). toModelServer Action Defines a model-server target. fromModelServer Action Defines a model-server source. toLocal Action Defines a local target (MPS). includeModule String Includes the module specified by the given fully qualified name in the synchronisation process. includeModulesByPrefix String Includes all modules, whose fully qualified name starts with the given prefix, in the synchronisation process. excludeModule String Excludes the module specified by the fully qualified name from the included modules. excludeModuleByPrefix String Excludes all modules, whose fully qualified name starts with the given prefix, from the included modules. enableContinueOnError Boolean If the sync encounters an error, simply log it and continue instead of terminating. This most likely results in an incomplete sync result. Defaults to false. setting type description mpsHome File Location of the MPS to be used for the sync. Alternatively, you can just specify an MPS version that is then downloaded automatically. This is handled by a different plugin that you can configure like this: mpsBuild { mpsVersion(\"2021.2.5\") } mpsLibrary File A folder containing MPS modules that the MPS project in repositoryDir depends on. Multiple folders can be specified. mpsHeapSize String MPS heap size specified as a String, e.g. \"2g\" for 2GB (default: \"2g\") repositoryDir File Directory in which the modules are stored. mpsDebugPort Int If set, the headless MPS will suspend on startup and wait for a remote debugger on the specified port. mpsPlugin PluginSpec Add a plugin to be loaded when running MPS. jetbrains.mps.core, jetbrains.mps.testing, jetbrains.mps.ide.make are always loaded. All other plugins, even bundled ones, must be configured explicitly. In general cases, the sync does not rely on concepts (and in turn on languages and plugins) of the synced nodes. Loading other plugins might become necessary when they provide custom persistence and in other, yet unknown cases. First, try if the sync works for your project without adding plugins. In the future you will be required to specify a repositoryId along the revision. setting type description url String URL of the model-server API endpoint. repositoryId String Id of the target/source model-server repository. If the repository does not exist on the model-server, it will be created including a master branch. branchName String Name of the target/source model-server branch. If the target branch does not exist on the model-server, it will be created. revision String Source model-server revision. Can be used instead of repositoryId and branchName. Only available in ServerSource. baseRevision String Source model-server base revision. If specified, only the subtrees that changed between baseRevision and revision will be synchronized. Only available in ServerSource. requestTimeoutSeconds Integer The request timeout measured in seconds to apply when performing HTTP requests towards the model-server. Default: 5 minutes metaProperties MutableMap Custom properties that will be attached to the root node. The mapping is propertyName → propertyValue.

In case your metamodel comes from another source this is an external entry point: As long as you can export your metamodel to JSON, you can use model-api-gen. To use JSON from another source or JSON files from a previous export, you can skip this step by simply specifying a directory, which contains the JSON files, in the configuration of the gradle task: metamodel { //... jsonDir = File(\"path/to/json/dir\") } As a result, all MPS-specific configuration settings will be ignored and the specified directory will be used for the next step. JSON to model API generation In the second step, the previously generated JSON files containing the metamodel are being used to generate the typed API using the Kotlin/TypeScript generator in model-api-gen. Inside of the metamodel block the following settings can be configured. setting type description javaExecutable File Location of the Java executable moduleFolders ArrayList Directories, that contain the language modules mpsHome File Home directory of MPS mpsHeapSize String MPS heap size specified as a String, e.g. \"2g\" for 2GB includedLanguages Set Set of languages, for which an API should be generated includedLanguageNamespaces Set Set of language namespaces, for which an API should be generated includedConcepts Set Set of concepts, for which an API should be generated includedModules Set Set of modules, for which an API should be generated jsonDir File Directory containing JSON files, which represent a metamodel. Will be used as input for the generation. Specifying this will skip the export from MPS and all MPS-specific configurations will be ignored. kotlinDir File Target Kotlin directory of the generator modelqlKotlinDir File The generation of the ModelQL API is optional, because the output has a dependency on the ModelQL runtime. If this option is set, you have to add a dependency on org.modelix:modelql-typed.

Bringing models to the cloud requires an alternative to the file system (and git) based storage of models. Modelix implements a data structure that allows replication between all MPS instances connected to the same model-server. It is very similar to the git storage format, but instead of files it stores nodes in its key-value data store. To support real-time collaboration, in addition to the snapshot of a version, the model-server also stores the operations that were applied on the previous version to produce the new version. Conflicts between concurrent modification are resolved using operational transformation (OT). The usually hard part of OT is to guarantee convergence, meaning that all clients end up with the same result independent of the order in which they receive changes. This problem becomes trivial, because versions are identified by a hash over all the content. Any divergence will result in a different hash which can easily be detected. The remaining problem is what to do when a divergence is detected. From git we know that switching between versions is fast, because it only has to apply the difference between these versions. The same is true here: Fixing a divergence is as easy as switching to the correct version. If a client does not have any local changes it does not even need to apply the change operations itself - it can just switch to the new version. So in the rare case of a divergence fixing it is nothing special and is an operation that happens all the time. While this component is independent of MPS, it is possible to replicates the data of the MPS internal module repository into a running model-server. This can be achieved using the modelix MPS plugin: One can connect an MPS instances to a model-server, upload the current module repository, and keep it synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor - both options are supported at the same time. Valid keys are keys starting with the PROTECTED_PREFIX ($$$). For details please refer to the OpenAPI documentation under doc/model-server.json. By default, the model server doesn’t check any permissions. To enable it you can specify the following environment variables. Variable Description MODELIX_PERMISSION_CHECKS_ENABLED By default, permission checking is enabled when an algorithm for the JWT signature or a MODELIX_JWK_URI is configured. This variable can be set explicitly to true or false to avoid security issues by a misconfigured algorithm. MODELIX_GENERATE_FAKE_JWT By default, if no signature algorithm and no MODELIX_JWK_URI is configured, a token is generated for all requests with the identity unit-tests@example.com and no permissions. This option can be set to true or false to enable/disable this behaviour explicitly. MODELIX_JWT_SIGNATURE_HMAC512_KEY MODELIX_JWT_SIGNATURE_HMAC384_KEY MODELIX_JWT_SIGNATURE_HMAC256_KEY If JWT tokens are signed with the HMAC algorithm, this variable specifies the secret key. The org.modelix:authorization library provides a utility function createModelixAccessToken for creating valid tokens signed with this algorithm, MODELIX_JWT_SIGNATURE_HMAC512_KEY_FILE MODELIX_JWT_SIGNATURE_HMAC384_KEY_FILE MODELIX_JWT_SIGNATURE_HMAC256_KEY_FILE Instead of specifying the key directly via MODELIX_JWT_SIGNATURE_HMAC512_KEY a path to a file containing the key can be specified. This is useful when keys are stored in kubernetes secrets. MODELIX_JWK_URI If keys are created and signed by some OpenID connect server the public keys are provided via HTTP. Here you can specify the URI of the key set. Only RSA (256, 384 and 512) keys are currently supported. MODELIX_JWK_KEY_ID Optional key ID that can be used together with MODELIX_JWK_URI. If specified, it ensures that only tokens that use the specified key are valid. If not specified, a token can use any RSA (256, 384 and 512) key provided by MODELIX_JWK_URI. The permissions claim of the token is expected to list directly granted permission. Additional granted permissions may be derived from that list. For example, an model-server/admin permission gives access to all repositories and administrative actions. repository/someRepository/admin on the other hand, gives only permission to all actions on the repository \"someRepository\". A detailed list of all permissions can be found on the model server at /permissions.","title":"A Cloud Model Storage/Repository: The modelix model-server","component":"modelix","version":"main","name":"component-model-server","url":"/modelix/main/core/reference/component-model-server.html","titles":[{"text":"Real-Time Collaboration and Operational Transformation","hash":"_real_time_collaboration_and_operational_transformation","id":1},{"text":"MPS and the model-server","hash":"_mps_and_the_model_server","id":2},{"text":"APIs","hash":"_apis","id":3},{"text":"JSON web tokens (JWT) based authorization","hash":"_json_web_tokens_jwt_based_authorization","id":4}]},"42":{"id":42,"text":"Repository | Nexus The @modelix/vue-model-api can be used to create Vue.js applications, that interact with a model server by reading and writing models. @modelix/vue-model-api provides Vue.js composable to connect to the model server.

MPS is running in headless mode on the server with an HTTP server installed as a plugin. The browser connects to that server and receives the HTML and JavaScript code required for the interactive model editor. A second plugin connects to a model-server and replicates the data into MPS’ internal module repository. All MPS instances connected to that model server will stay synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor. Both options are supported at the same time. The next image gives an overview over the different docker images running in the kubernetes cluster. The model server uses an Apache Ignite cluster and just provides a REST API on top of it. A high load can be distributed over multiple instances. Running multiple MPS instances for scalability is possible, because the model has the same state on all instances. If you want to run MPS instances with different configurations (languages, plugins) or allow external instances to connect to the model server, a reverse proxy is used to forward the request to the correct instance. To access the web editor a user has to login in with a google account first. An OAuth proxy takes care of that and adds an HTTP header with the users e-mail address to the request. modelix provides an editor in the browser for the languages implemented in MPS. This can be an image based editor that renders the editor in MPS using the default editor definition or an HTML based editor that requires a separate editor definition in a language provided by modelix. Common to both approaches is that the user input (keyboard, mouse) is processed on the server and the update of the projection after a model change also happens on the server. Even in case of the HTML based editor the resulting HTML is computed on the server side. This removes the need to replicate the model into the browser, which would result in a bad performance in case of big models.

To make it easier for developers, the modelix platform is currently released twice a year as a single \"platform release\" which references compatible component versions. We aim to provide a Spring release R1 and an Autumn release R2. All development in-between is carried out as patches on the releases. This release cycle starts from 2023 with the first release on the MPS Community meetup in May: 2023.R1. To gain an overview over existing components, please refer to the list of components here. The following image shows a dense overview of our current roadmap. The aim of this roadmap is to provide you with a more detailed overview of our plans. We have compiled a catalog of our significant areas, which are our top priorities we focus on delivering. In the following we shortly list these key priorities. Below you can find more detailed explanations for each of these. Model APIs: A unified low-level API to navigate and modify models. It is untyped to any existing meta-model. Domain-Specific Model API generator: A complete rewrite of our initial API generator which overcomes multiple previous shortcomings. It provides type information and directly integrates with the model API. Versioning / Releases / Roadmap: Automated semantic versioning with unifying modelix platform releases twice a year. Development is planned over at issues.modelix.org. Documentation: Docs-as-code approach which is built to docs.modelix.org with every platform release. Git integration: A tighter integration for git based model storage to bridge legacy storage solutions. MPS in the Cloud: Run MPS in the cloud as a way to transition to the web. Language Evolution: A way to handle new language versions and metamodel changes. Graphical Editors: We plan to provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API to enable graphical editors on the wev. LIonWeb: Integration with other web components out there - modelix support and involvement in the LIonWeb (Language interfaces on the web) initiative. Several modelix artifacts had potentially confusing names. We streamlined everything and renamed to convey functionality more clearly. Check out our blog post for details. Also check the new table of modelix component overview here. Modelix uses a low level meta-model agnostic API across all components. The model-api provides this abstraction. This API is the shared basis and used across all modelix components. It is a Kotlin multi-platform implementation with artifacts for JVM and JS. An untyped access to model content is possible when only using the model-api. In case you want to use typed access, the model-api-gen provides a generator which generates a typed model API from your existing domain-specific meta-model. This generated API specializes the untyped model-api and provides domain grounded model access. Up to now, the model API generator api-gen was used to generate a domain-specific Java model API from a MPS structure. These classes can then be used in web applications to obtain typed model content from the model-server. The api-gen was implemented as a MPS generator and consequently bound to and limited by the MPS ecosystem. To overcome the many shortcomings we observed (runtime & resource usage, tool lock-in, maintainability, few target languages). We re-implement the generator (now model-api-gen`) in Kotlin, which has several benefits. Most notably, there is now an additional option to generate a domain-specific TypeScript API. One extra feature we add is MPS meta-model independence: In a new intermediate step, we export the MPS structure to a JSON representation re-using the JSON language of the existing MPS extensions. This intermediate artifact is then used by the api-gen v2 to generate the APIs. The MPS structure to JSON generator is available for all MPS versions so that previous maintenance of the api-gen v1 for multiple MPS versions is not necessary any more. To ease the use of the new model-api-gen, we provide a Gradle plugin to help setting up the domain-specific API generation: model-api-gen-gradle. With many modelix components being in various development stages - from stable to early and conceptual - they are released individually. Generally, modelix follows the Semantic Versioning scheme for releases and groups different components by repository (e.g. core components are in modelix.core, while documentation resides in modelix.docs). However, anything based on JetBrains MPS (e.g. MPS plugins or extensions) is prefixed with the corresponding MPS major and minor version number followed by our own patch version number. For example, the org.modelix.mps-model-plugin version 2021.2.103 is the 103rd release which is compatible with MPS 2021.2. To make it easier for developers, the modelix platform will be released twice a year as a single modelix platform release which aggregates all compatible component versions. We aim to provide a Spring release (modelix-2X.1) and an Autumn release (modelix-2X.2). All development in-between is carried out as patches on the releases. This release cycle starts from 2023 with the first release on the MPS Community meetup in May: modelix-23.1. For the different MPS versions there are sub-platforms that also bundle the corresponding MPS plugins of the modelix platform. The artifacts which hold the Gradle platform thus will be org.modelix.platform` org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-2 org.modelix.platform-mps-2020-3 org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-1 org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-3 Additionally, we want to communicate our plans for the modelix platform more clearly. As a result we prepared a roadmap outlining our planned steps. Further, on issues.modelix.org we also give more insights in our development efforts. To further reduce the barrier of entry to modelix with modelix-23.1 we deploy new documentation following the docs-as-code approach. You can access the new documentation over at docs.modelix.org which is available for each modelix platform release. We follow the Diataxis documentation framework to separate and communicate more clearly in the categories of Tutorials, How To Guides, Explanation, and (technical) Reference. Additionally api.modelix.org provides a generated technical API reference which we grow incrementally. Generally, we recommend using the model-server as the storage backend for models in the cloud. However, in some environments and use cases, this philosophy can only partially be archived. In rare cases we observe a hybrid setup where a) model knowledge is stored in files as MPS projects in combination with git while b) deploying web and cloud centric applications using the model-server. In a first iteration, we want to provide the possibility for read and write of MPS models from and to git repositories in the modelix platform. This could eventually also include the usage of the model-server for real-time collaboration in these hybrid setups. However, this is a topic which requires further investigation. For many MPS based projects, a good first step for transitioning to the web is running MPS in the cloud. modelix already has elaborate prototypes for these use-cases by using Kubernetes and Projector to provide MPS “Workspaces” in the cloud. One central piece for this are the modelix build-tools. This component allows the generation of MPS languages without any existing build script. We want to refine our efforts regarding MPS in the cloud and make them more accessible. When using MPS, model migrations are made easy using the migration aspect. However, once stepping outside of MPS, migrations become more difficult. Model migration needs to be carried out across platforms, teams and (web) applications when a new language version is deployed. We want to support a generated APIs that can work with multiple versions at the same time with which we also can support meta-model versions checks for compatibility. We have some ideas we need to further refine and explore in the following releases. The experience from MPS shows that the requirements for a graphical editor are too diverse to support all of them with a single framework. There are many different frameworks available in the web world where you can choose the one that fits your use case. We plan to only provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API, but not the integration of any diagram framework itself. Modelix focuses on a good integration with MPS. If you are interested in the integration of other modeling technologies then check out the LIonWeb project (short for Language Interfaces on the web). They specify more general interfaces and use the modelix model-server for data storage and exchange in their current prototypes. The modelix team co-authored and is involved with the LIonWeb initiative.","title":"Development, Releases, and Roadmap","component":"modelix","version":"23.1","name":"roadmap","url":"/modelix/23.1/main/roadmap.html","titles":[{"text":"Development","hash":"_development","id":1},{"text":"Release Cycle","hash":"_release_cycle","id":2},{"text":"Roadmap","hash":"_roadmap","id":3},{"text":"Key priorities overview","hash":"_key_priorities_overview","id":4},{"text":"Component Renaming (23.1)","hash":"_component_renaming_23_1","id":5},{"text":"Model APIs (23.1)","hash":"_model_apis_23_1","id":6},{"text":"Domain-Specific Model API Generator (23.1)","hash":"_domain_specific_model_api_generator_23_1","id":7},{"text":"Versioning / Releases / Roadmap (23.1)","hash":"_versioning_releases_roadmap_23_1","id":8},{"text":"Documentation (23.1)","hash":"_documentation_23_1","id":9},{"text":"Git Integration (estimated 23.2)","hash":"_git_integration_estimated_23_2","id":10},{"text":"MPS in the Cloud (estimated 23.2)","hash":"_mps_in_the_cloud_estimated_23_2","id":11},{"text":"Language Evolution (estimated 24.1)","hash":"_language_evolution_estimated_24_1","id":12},{"text":"Graphical Editors in the Web (estimated 24.2)","hash":"_graphical_editors_in_the_web_estimated_24_2","id":13},{"text":"LIonWeb","hash":"_lionweb","id":14}]},"56":{"id":56,"text":"This page represents a fallback page for open TODOs within the documentation.

It intends to show how one introduces a clearly defined domain-specific abstraction decoupling the language engineering (meta-modeling) and the web development. We provide two backends (i.e. implementations of the API layer): The API via modelQL and API via model-server components. ▶️ For more details, see the OpenAPI component documentation. This project provides two implementations of the openapi domain abstraction. MPS as a source This backend provides access to the model by obtaining the model knowledge directly from a running MPS instance. It is implemented using ktor and connects to a model-client plugin running inside of MPS. This component can only provide read and write access. ▶️ For more details, see the API via modelQL for details. model-server as a source This backend provides access to the model by connecting to a running model-server. It is implemented using Quarkus and can provide read access to the underlying model. Additionally, a websocket for push notifications about ongoing model changes is provided. This is realized using websockets exposed by the model-server. ▶️ For more details, also see the API via model-server component for details. The dashboard provides access to model knowledge through a browser. As it is conforming to the OpenAPI specification, the dashboard is able to obtain the model content from both backend implementations. However, the dashboard is consequently limited by the chosen backend.

The main concepts of the language are: Room: where lecture are held. Each room has a maximum capacity of students, a name and some additional properties. Lecture: Have a name, some description and reference a room where they are held.

These components include among others the model-server, model-api-gen, model-api-gen-gradle, and light-model-client. All components in this repository have no dependencies to JetBrains MPS. The modelix project uses Gradle to build the individual components. Simply call the following in the top level folder of a repository: ./gradlew build # mac/linux or if you are on windows use: gradlew.bat build # windows Wherever possible we use the latest IntelliJ IDEA IDE to manage projects in our repositories. Consequently, opening any repository with IntelliJ will also allow you to build and eventually contribute. At the moment most modelix artifacts are stored on the itemis nexus with no access restriction. As a consequence, when you build modelix or use modelix components via Gradle there is no repository access setup required. This is optional when you want to obtain modelix artifacts from GitHub packages rather than the itemis nexus server. Most packages are also published to GitHub packages for which a GithHub account and credentials are required. To access GitHub packaged you need to specify your credentials. First of all you will need to generate a personal access token with access to GitHub Packages. The project assumes that your username is available as the variable gpr.user and the token as gpr.key. The easiest way to configure the credentials is copy the example below, paste it into the gradle.properties file in the repository and replace the values with your credentials: gpr.user= gpr.key= Gradle also supports other locations for specifying these properties.","title":"Welcome to modelix.core!","component":"modelix","version":"23.1","name":"index","url":"/modelix/23.1/core/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":2},{"text":"Build components using Gradle","hash":"_build_components_using_gradle","id":3},{"text":"Build from console","hash":"_build_from_console","id":4},{"text":"IntelliJ Idea","hash":"_intellij_idea","id":5},{"text":"modelix Artifact Publication","hash":"_modelix_artifact_publication","id":6},{"text":"How to set up GitHub packages authentication","hash":"_how_to_set_up_github_packages_authentication","id":7}]},"79":{"id":79,"text":"TODO","title":"modelix.core Explanation","component":"modelix","version":"23.1","name":"index","url":"/modelix/23.1/core/explanation/index.html","titles":[]},"80":{"id":80,"text":"TODO","title":"modelix.core How-To","component":"modelix","version":"23.1","name":"index","url":"/modelix/23.1/core/howto/index.html","titles":[]},"81":{"id":81,"text":"If you are interested in a more practical usage of what is presented here, check out the samples project Creating an instance that loads the entire model from the server can be done like this: val client = LightModelClient.builder() .url(\"ws://localhost/json/v2/test-repo/ws\") // optional, by default it connects to the MPS plugin .build() You have to set a model query using changeQuery() to tell the server in what data you are interested in.

doc | Repository | buildfile | Artifacts: Nexus GitHub Packages The model-api-gen.gradle.plugin is a Gradle plugin that wraps the functionality of the MPS solution for metamodel-export and Model API Generator. It provides an additional Gradle task which will apply a 2-staged process: MPS metamodel export to JSON (optional) In the first step the metamodel-export MPS solution is executed by the plugin to export the MPS structure aspect (i.e. the metamodel) to JSON files. In case your metamodel comes from another source this is an external entry point: As long as you can export your metamodel to JSON, you can use model-api-gen. To use JSON from another source or JSON files from a previous export, you can skip this step by simply specifying a directory, which contains the JSON files, in the configuration of the gradle task: metamodel { //... jsonDir = File(\"path/to/json/dir\") } As a result, all MPS-specific configuration settings will be ignored and the specified directory will be used for the next step.

Bringing models to the cloud requires an alternative to the file system (and git) based storage of models. Modelix implements a data structure that allows replication between all MPS instances connected to the same model-server. It is very similar to the git storage format, but instead of files it stores nodes in its key-value data store. To support real-time collaboration, in addition to the snapshot of a version, the model-server also stores the operations that were applied on the previous version to produce the new version. Conflicts between concurrent modification are resolved using operational transformation (OT). The usually hard part of OT is to guarantee convergence, meaning that all clients end up with the same result independent of the order in which they receive changes. This problem becomes trivial, because versions are identified by a hash over all the content. Any divergence will result in a different hash which can easily be detected. The remaining problem is what to do when a divergence is detected. From git we know that switching between versions is fast, because it only has to apply the difference between these versions. The same is true here: Fixing a divergence is as easy as switching to the correct version. If a client does not have any local changes it does not even need to apply the change operations itself - it can just switch to the new version. So in the rare case of a divergence fixing it is nothing special and is an operation that happens all the time. While this component is independent of MPS, it is possible to replicates the data of the MPS internal module repository into a running model-server. This can be achieved using the modelix MPS plugin: One can connect an MPS instances to a model-server, upload the current module repository, and keep it synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor - both options are supported at the same time.

We follow the systematic Diátaxis[2] approach in this documentation. As a result, we separate the documentation in the following four mayor categories: Tutorials (learning-oriented) Lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. New users usually start here. How-To Guides Reference There is also a dedicated API page where you can find component specific API documentaion over at https://api.docs.modelix.org. Explanation This documentation is built using the Antora framework. All individual software components contain their own documentation within their own repository but are aggregated here. The playbook for aggregation and central source source for this documentation can be found in the modelix/modelix.doc repository. If you find any bugs or errors in our documentation please add pull requests or issues in the corresponding repository. In this documentation we use various acronyms and domain-specific wording.

MPS is running in headless mode on the server with an HTTP server installed as a plugin. The browser connects to that server and receives the HTML and JavaScript code required for the interactive model editor. A second plugin connects to a model-server and replicates the data into MPS’ internal module repository. All MPS instances connected to that model server will stay synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor. Both options are supported at the same time. The next image gives an overview over the different docker images running in the kubernetes cluster. The model server uses an Apache Ignite cluster and just provides a REST API on top of it. A high load can be distributed over multiple instances. Running multiple MPS instances for scalability is possible, because the model has the same state on all instances. If you want to run MPS instances with different configurations (languages, plugins) or allow external instances to connect to the model server, a reverse proxy is used to forward the request to the correct instance. To access the web editor a user has to login in with a google account first. An OAuth proxy takes care of that and adds an HTTP header with the users e-mail address to the request. modelix provides an editor in the browser for the languages implemented in MPS. This can be an image based editor that renders the editor in MPS using the default editor definition or an HTML based editor that requires a separate editor definition in a language provided by modelix. Common to both approaches is that the user input (keyboard, mouse) is processed on the server and the update of the projection after a model change also happens on the server. Even in case of the HTML based editor the resulting HTML is computed on the server side. This removes the need to replicate the model into the browser, which would result in a bad performance in case of big models. Running MPS in the cloud requires an alternative to the file system for storing models. modelix implements a data structure that allows replication between all MPS instances connected to the same model server. It is very similar to the git storage format, but instead of files it stores nodes in its key-value data store. To support realtime collaboration, in addition to the snapshot of a version it also stores the operations that were applied on the previous version to produce the new version. Conflicts between concurrent modification are resolved using operational transformation (OT). The usually hard part of OT is to guarantee convergence, meaning that all clients end up with the same result indepent of the order in which they receive changes. This problem becomes trivial, because versions are identified by a hash over all the content. Any divergence will result in a different hash which can easily be detected. The remaining problem is what to do when a divergence is detected. From git we know that switching between versions is fast, because it only has to apply the difference between these versions. The same is true here. Fixing a divergence is as easy as switching to the correct version. If a client doesn’t have any local changes it doesn’t even need to apply the change operations itself. It can just switch to the new version. So in the rare case of a divergence fixing it is nothing special. It’s an operation that happens all the time.","title":"Architecture","component":"modelix","version":"23.2","name":"architecture","url":"/modelix/23.2/explanation/architecture.html","titles":[{"text":"An architectural overview of the modelix project","hash":"_an_architectural_overview_of_the_modelix_project","id":1},{"text":"Editor","hash":"_editor","id":2},{"text":"Model","hash":"_model","id":3}]},"96":{"id":96,"text":"This glossary is a lose collection of keywords used throughout the modelix documentation.

Modelix is a platform to bring models to the web. It consists of multiple components, which can be combined in different ways to support a variety of use cases. It is important to note, that modelix is neither a language workbench in the traditional sense nor a one-size-fits-all solution. The modelix project aims to provide you with building blocks, which empower you to construct your own application with ease. The following table gives an overview over essential components, which you are very likely to encounter when using modelix. For a full list of components check out the components table. Component Short description model-api Untyped API, which allows to interact with models. model-server Server, which persistently stores models. model-client Client, which implements the model-api and connects to a model-server. model-api-gen(-gradle) Component, which generates a typed, domain specific API based on a metamodel definition. The generated API wraps the untyped model-api. As a basic example, you might want to create a web app, which manipulates domain-specific models. In this case we assume a metamodel for such models exists as part of an MPS project. The image above shows how the essential components work together to form the backend for a web application. In this case the metamodel definition is generated from the structure aspect of a language in MPS. For a different use case it could also be from another (custom) source. The web application can then use the domain-specific API to manipulate and store models in the model-server. Of course, this example only scratches the surface of what is possible with modelix. Apart from the individual components, modelix can also provide a system called workspaces. It consists of multiple docker images, which run in a kubernetes cluster. Among other features, this system enables users to use projectional editors inside their browser by running MPS instances in the cloud. Modelix is always evolving.

We are dedicated to bring an updated version during December 2023 after our already scheduled planning sessions. Please check the documentation in the main branch of modelix. The following image shows a dense overview of our current roadmap. The aim of this roadmap is to provide you with a more detailed overview of our plans. We have compiled a catalog of our significant areas, which are our top priorities we focus on delivering. In the following we shortly list these key priorities. Below you can find more detailed explanations for each of these. Model APIs: A unified low-level API to navigate and modify models. It is untyped to any existing meta-model. Domain-Specific Model API generator: A complete rewrite of our initial API generator which overcomes multiple previous shortcomings. It provides type information and directly integrates with the model API. Versioning / Releases / Roadmap: Automated semantic versioning with unifying modelix platform releases twice a year. Development is planned over at issues.modelix.org. Documentation: Docs-as-code approach which is built to docs.modelix.org with every platform release. Git integration: A tighter integration for git based model storage to bridge legacy storage solutions. MPS in the Cloud: Run MPS in the cloud as a way to transition to the web. Language Evolution: A way to handle new language versions and metamodel changes. Graphical Editors: We plan to provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API to enable graphical editors on the wev. LIonWeb: Integration with other web components out there - modelix support and involvement in the LIonWeb (Language interfaces on the web) initiative. Several modelix artifacts had potentially confusing names. We streamlined everything and renamed to convey functionality more clearly. Check out our blog post for details. Also check the new table of modelix component overview here. Modelix uses a low level meta-model agnostic API across all components. The model-api provides this abstraction. This API is the shared basis and used across all modelix components. It is a Kotlin multi-platform implementation with artifacts for JVM and JS. An untyped access to model content is possible when only using the model-api. In case you want to use typed access, the model-api-gen provides a generator which generates a typed model API from your existing domain-specific meta-model. This generated API specializes the untyped model-api and provides domain grounded model access. Up to now, the model API generator api-gen was used to generate a domain-specific Java model API from a MPS structure. These classes can then be used in web applications to obtain typed model content from the model-server. The api-gen was implemented as a MPS generator and consequently bound to and limited by the MPS ecosystem. To overcome the many shortcomings we observed (runtime & resource usage, tool lock-in, maintainability, few target languages). We re-implement the generator (now model-api-gen`) in Kotlin, which has several benefits. Most notably, there is now an additional option to generate a domain-specific TypeScript API. One extra feature we add is MPS meta-model independence: In a new intermediate step, we export the MPS structure to a JSON representation re-using the JSON language of the existing MPS extensions. This intermediate artifact is then used by the api-gen v2 to generate the APIs. The MPS structure to JSON generator is available for all MPS versions so that previous maintenance of the api-gen v1 for multiple MPS versions is not necessary any more. To ease the use of the new model-api-gen, we provide a Gradle plugin to help setting up the domain-specific API generation: model-api-gen-gradle. With many modelix components being in various development stages - from stable to early and conceptual - they are released individually. Generally, modelix follows the Semantic Versioning scheme for releases and groups different components by repository (e.g. core components are in modelix.core, while documentation resides in modelix.docs). However, anything based on JetBrains MPS (e.g. MPS plugins or extensions) is prefixed with the corresponding MPS major and minor version number followed by our own patch version number. For example, the org.modelix.mps-model-plugin version 2021.2.103 is the 103rd release which is compatible with MPS 2021.2. To make it easier for developers, the modelix platform will be released twice a year as a single modelix platform release which aggregates all compatible component versions. We aim to provide a Spring release (modelix-2X.1) and an Autumn release (modelix-2X.2). All development in-between is carried out as patches on the releases. This release cycle starts from 2023 with the first release on the MPS Community meetup in May: modelix-23.1. For the different MPS versions there are sub-platforms that also bundle the corresponding MPS plugins of the modelix platform. The artifacts which hold the Gradle platform thus will be org.modelix.platform` org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-2 org.modelix.platform-mps-2020-3 org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-1 org.modelix.platform-mps-2021-3 Additionally, we want to communicate our plans for the modelix platform more clearly. As a result we prepared a roadmap outlining our planned steps. Further, on issues.modelix.org we also give more insights in our development efforts. To further reduce the barrier of entry to modelix with modelix-23.1 we deploy new documentation following the docs-as-code approach. You can access the new documentation over at docs.modelix.org which is available for each modelix platform release. We follow the Diataxis documentation framework to separate and communicate more clearly in the categories of Tutorials, How To Guides, Explanation, and (technical) Reference. Additionally api.modelix.org provides a generated technical API reference which we grow incrementally. Generally, we recommend using the model-server as the storage backend for models in the cloud. However, in some environments and use cases, this philosophy can only partially be archived. In rare cases we observe a hybrid setup where a) model knowledge is stored in files as MPS projects in combination with git while b) deploying web and cloud centric applications using the model-server. In a first iteration, we want to provide the possibility for read and write of MPS models from and to git repositories in the modelix platform. This could eventually also include the usage of the model-server for real-time collaboration in these hybrid setups. However, this is a topic which requires further investigation. For many MPS based projects, a good first step for transitioning to the web is running MPS in the cloud. modelix already has elaborate prototypes for these use-cases by using Kubernetes and Projector to provide MPS “Workspaces” in the cloud. One central piece for this are the modelix build-tools. This component allows the generation of MPS languages without any existing build script. We want to refine our efforts regarding MPS in the cloud and make them more accessible. When using MPS, model migrations are made easy using the migration aspect. However, once stepping outside of MPS, migrations become more difficult. Model migration needs to be carried out across platforms, teams and (web) applications when a new language version is deployed. We want to support a generated APIs that can work with multiple versions at the same time with which we also can support meta-model versions checks for compatibility. We have some ideas we need to further refine and explore in the following releases. The experience from MPS shows that the requirements for a graphical editor are too diverse to support all of them with a single framework. There are many different frameworks available in the web world where you can choose the one that fits your use case. We plan to only provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API, but not the integration of any diagram framework itself. Modelix focuses on a good integration with MPS. If you are interested in the integration of other modeling technologies then check out the LIonWeb project (short for Language Interfaces on the web). They specify more general interfaces and use the modelix model-server for data storage and exchange in their current prototypes. The modelix team co-authored and is involved with the LIonWeb initiative.","title":"Roadmap","component":"modelix","version":"23.2","name":"roadmap","url":"/modelix/23.2/main/roadmap.html","titles":[{"text":"Key priorities overview","hash":"_key_priorities_overview","id":1},{"text":"Component Renaming (23.1)","hash":"_component_renaming_23_1","id":2},{"text":"Model APIs (23.1)","hash":"_model_apis_23_1","id":3},{"text":"Domain-Specific Model API Generator (23.1)","hash":"_domain_specific_model_api_generator_23_1","id":4},{"text":"Versioning / Releases / Roadmap (23.1)","hash":"_versioning_releases_roadmap_23_1","id":5},{"text":"Documentation (23.1)","hash":"_documentation_23_1","id":6},{"text":"Git Integration (estimated 23.2)","hash":"_git_integration_estimated_23_2","id":7},{"text":"MPS in the Cloud (estimated 23.2)","hash":"_mps_in_the_cloud_estimated_23_2","id":8},{"text":"Language Evolution (estimated 24.1)","hash":"_language_evolution_estimated_24_1","id":9},{"text":"Graphical Editors in the Web (estimated 24.2)","hash":"_graphical_editors_in_the_web_estimated_24_2","id":10},{"text":"LIonWeb","hash":"_lionweb","id":11}]},"105":{"id":105,"text":"This page represents a fallback page for open TODOs within the documentation.

If your goal is to reuse MPS editors as is, then modelix itself ships with a Projector integration to achieve this. While all the examples use the same language defined in MPS they are not meant as one complete example but rather as individual parts. The purpose of the examples is to give inspiration for what is possible with modelix and make you think about and envision your own use cases. To work with the samples, you need the following software installed.: MPS 2021.2.6 Java 11 Docker and Docker Compose Alternatives like Podman might work, but have not been tested.

Each use case uses different components from the modelix platform to create custom solutions. On this page, you can get an overview of all use cases, and see how they are related and what their essential differences are. In the first use case, an MPS project is synchronized to a repository on a model server by utilizing the model-server-sync-plugin. It shows how to make model data, previously accessible only in a running MPS or via files, available through a server. In itself, this use case has little value, but the next use cases build in part on it. See the Use case 1 page for details. In this use case, we connect web frontends to a model server. The web frontends read from and write model data to the model server. One web frontend can be used to edit model data and is implemented with Vue.js. The other one serves as an overview and is implemented with Angular. You can see how changes made in one connected application are instantly reflected in another connected application. You can also connect an MPS to the model server and see how changes made in the application are synced to MPS and vice versa. The frontend applications directly use the model-client JavaScript library that connects to the model server. They also use a TypeScript API generated by the Model API generator from the metamodel to enable type-safe access to data structures provided by the model client. See the Use case 2 page for details. In this use case, a web frontend connects to a web backend, which in turn communicates with a model server. Like in use case 2 model data is synced automatically between the model server, the application and MPS. A backend is needed if you need to control what data a client might read and write. It is also useful to translate data from modelix data structures into a data structure that is suitable for your web applications. The web backend is implemented with Quarkus. It uses the model-client to connect to a model server. It also uses a Kotlin API generated by the Model API generator from the metamodel to enable type-safe access to data structures provided by the model client. For the Angular based web frontend, the web backend provides a custom HTTP- and websocket-based API.

The data communicated between the model server and web backend are modelix-specific data structures without information about the metamodel. In the backend, those data structures are wrapped with generated Kotlin classes generated by the Model API generator from the metamodel. The backend programmer can use this so-called domain-specific-language API to access model data more type-safely. The web backend exposes a custom application-specific API, which the web frontend uses to communicate and read and write data.

While the data structure for model replication in Modelix supports partial loading of models, you still need a way to describe which data you need on the client. Loading data on demand while traversing the model also results in a poor performance, because of the potentially large number of fine-grained request. A first attempt to solve this problem was to disallow lazy loading and require the client to load all required data at the beginning, before working with the model. A special query language was used to filter the data and an attempt to access a node that is not included by that query resulted in an exception, forcing the developer to adjust the query. While this results in a more predictable performance, it is also hard to maintain and still not optimal for the performance. You have to download all the data at the beginning that you might eventually need, potentially exceeding the available memory of the system. The ModelQL query language provides a more dynamic way of loading parts of the model on demand, but still allows reducing the number of request to a minimum. The downside is that it’s not just a different implementation hidden behind the model-api, but requires to use a different API. The query language is inspired by Reactive Streams and the execution engine uses Kotlin Flows, which is a Coroutines compatible implementation of Reactive Streams. Often it’s useful to know if a stream is expected to return only one element or multiple elements. Project Reactor, another implementation of Reactive Streams, introduced the notion of Mono and Flux to distinguish them. You will also find them in ModelQL.","title":"ModelQL","component":"modelix","version":"23.2","name":"modelql","url":"/modelix/23.2/core/explanation/modelql.html","titles":[{"text":"Reactive Streams","hash":"_reactive_streams","id":1}]},"120":{"id":120,"text":"TODO","title":"modelix.core How-To","component":"modelix","version":"23.2","name":"index","url":"/modelix/23.2/core/howto/index.html","titles":[]},"121":{"id":121,"text":"ModelQL defines its own HTTP endpoint and provides server/client implementations for it. The model-server and the mps-model-server-plugin already implement this endpoint. The client can be created like this: val client = ModelQLClient.builder().url(\"http://localhost/query\").httpClient(httpClient).build() val result: List = client.query { root -> root.children(\"modules\").property(\"name\").toList() } When creating a LightModelClient you can optionally provide a ModelQLClient instance, which allows invoking .query { …​ } (see below) on a node returned by the LightModelClient. val modelqlClient = ModelQLClient.builder().build() val client = LightModelClient.builder().modelQLClient(modelqlClient).build() val result: List = client.getRootNode()!!.query { it.children(\"modules\").property(\"name\").toList() } You can use the model-api-gen-gradle plugin to generate type safe extensions from your meta-model. Specify the modelqlKotlinDir property to enable the generation. val result: List = client.query { root -> root.children(\"classes\").ofConcept(C_ClassConcept) .member .ofConcept(C_StaticMethodDeclaration) .filter { it.visibility.instanceOf(C_PublicVisibility) } .toList() } If a query returns a node, you can execute a new query starting from that node. val cls: ClassConcept = client.query { it.children(\"classes\").ofConcept(C_ClassConcept).first() } val names = cls.query { it.member.ofConcept(C_StaticMethodDeclaration).name.toList() } For convenience, it’s possible to access further data of that node using the INode API, but this is not recommended though, because each access sends a new query to the server. val cls: ClassConcept = client.query { it.children(\"classes\").ofConcept(C_ClassConcept).first() } val className = cls.name While returning a list of elements is simple, the purpose of the query language is to reduce the number of request to a minimum. This requires combining multiple values into more complex data structures. The zip operation provides a simple way of doing that: val result: List>> = query { db -> db.products.map { val id = it.id val title = it.title val images = it.images.toList() id.zip(title, images) }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.first}, Title: ${it.second}, Images: ${it.third}\") } This is suitable for combining a small number of values, but because of the missing variable names it can be hard to read for a larger number of values or even multiple zip operations assembled into a hierarchical data structure. This can be solved by defining custom data classes and using the mapLocal operation: data class MyProduct(val id: Int, val title: String, val images: List) data class MyImage(val url: String) val result: List = remoteProductDatabaseQuery { db -> db.products.map { val id = it.id val title = it.title val images = it.images.mapLocal { MyImage(it) }.toList() id.zip(title, images).mapLocal { MyProduct(it.first, it.second, it.third) } }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.id}, Title: ${it.title}, Images: ${it.images}\") } The mapLocal operation is not just useful in combination with the zip operation, but in general to create instances of classes only known to the client. The body of mapLocal is executed on the client after receiving the result from the server. That’s why you only have access to the output of the zip operation and still have to use first, second and third inside the query. To make this even more readable there is a buildLocalMapping operation, which provides a different syntax for the zip-mapLocal chain. data class MyProduct(val id: Int, val title: String, val images: List) data class MyImage(val url: String) val result: List = query { db -> db.products.buildLocalMapping { val id = it.id.request() val title = it.title.request() val images = it.images.mapLocal { MyImage(it) }.toList().request() onSuccess { MyProduct(id.get(), title.get(), images.get()) } }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.id}, Title: ${it.title}, Images: ${it.images}\") } At the beginning of the buildLocalMapping body, you invoke request() on all the values you need to assemble your object. This basically adds the operand to the internal zip operation and returns an object that gives you access to the value after receiving it from the server. Inside the onSuccess block you assemble the local object using the previously requested values. One use case of the query language is to build database applications that generate HTML pages from the data stored in the model server. You can use the Kotlin HTML DSL together with ModelQL to do that. Use buildHtmlQuery to request data from the server and render it into an HTML string: val html = query { it.map(buildHtmlQuery { val modules = input.children(\"modules\").requestFragment { val moduleName = input.property(\"name\").request() val models = input.children(\"models\").requestFragment { val modelName = input.property(\"name\").request() onSuccess { div { h2 { +\"Model: ${modelName.get()}\" } } } } onSuccess { div { h1 { +\"Module: ${moduleName.get()}\" } insertFragment(models) } } } onSuccess { body { insertFragment(modules) } } }) } buildHtmlQuery and the requestFragment operation are similar to the buildLocalMapping operation, but inside the onSuccess block you use the Kotlin HTML DSL.","title":"ModelQL","component":"modelix","version":"23.2","name":"modelql","url":"/modelix/23.2/core/howto/modelql.html","titles":[{"text":"Independent ModelQLClient","hash":"_independent_modelqlclient","id":1},{"text":"Integration with LightModelClient","hash":"_integration_with_lightmodelclient","id":2},{"text":"Type-safe ModelQL API","hash":"_type_safe_modelql_api","id":3},{"text":"Run query on an INode","hash":"_run_query_on_an_inode","id":4},{"text":"Complex query results","hash":"_complex_query_results","id":5},{"text":"Kotlin HTML integration","hash":"_kotlin_html_integration","id":6}]},"122":{"id":122,"text":"If you want to test code that processes model-api instances, you can do this in-process without a running (light-) model-server.

It provides an additional Gradle task which will apply a 2-staged process: MPS metamodel export to JSON (optional) In the first step the metamodel-export MPS solution is executed by the plugin to export the MPS structure aspect (i.e. the metamodel) to JSON files. In case your metamodel comes from another source this is an external entry point: As long as you can export your metamodel to JSON, you can use model-api-gen. To use JSON from another source or JSON files from a previous export, you can skip this step by simply specifying a directory, which contains the JSON files, in the configuration of the gradle task: metamodel { //... jsonDir = File(\"path/to/json/dir\") } As a result, all MPS-specific configuration settings will be ignored and the specified directory will be used for the next step.

Bringing models to the cloud requires an alternative to the file system (and git) based storage of models. Modelix implements a data structure that allows replication between all MPS instances connected to the same model-server. It is very similar to the git storage format, but instead of files it stores nodes in its key-value data store. To support real-time collaboration, in addition to the snapshot of a version, the model-server also stores the operations that were applied on the previous version to produce the new version. Conflicts between concurrent modification are resolved using operational transformation (OT). The usually hard part of OT is to guarantee convergence, meaning that all clients end up with the same result independent of the order in which they receive changes. This problem becomes trivial, because versions are identified by a hash over all the content. Any divergence will result in a different hash which can easily be detected. The remaining problem is what to do when a divergence is detected. From git we know that switching between versions is fast, because it only has to apply the difference between these versions. The same is true here: Fixing a divergence is as easy as switching to the correct version. If a client does not have any local changes it does not even need to apply the change operations itself - it can just switch to the new version. So in the rare case of a divergence fixing it is nothing special and is an operation that happens all the time. While this component is independent of MPS, it is possible to replicates the data of the MPS internal module repository into a running model-server. This can be achieved using the modelix MPS plugin: One can connect an MPS instances to a model-server, upload the current module repository, and keep it synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor - both options are supported at the same time.

MPS is running in headless mode on the server with an HTTP server installed as a plugin. The browser connects to that server and receives the HTML and JavaScript code required for the interactive model editor. A second plugin connects to a model-server and replicates the data into MPS’ internal module repository. All MPS instances connected to that model server will stay synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor. Both options are supported at the same time. The next image gives an overview over the different docker images running in the kubernetes cluster. The model server uses an Apache Ignite cluster and just provides a REST API on top of it. A high load can be distributed over multiple instances. Running multiple MPS instances for scalability is possible, because the model has the same state on all instances. If you want to run MPS instances with different configurations (languages, plugins) or allow external instances to connect to the model server, a reverse proxy is used to forward the request to the correct instance. To access the web editor a user has to login in with a google account first. An OAuth proxy takes care of that and adds an HTTP header with the users e-mail address to the request. modelix provides an editor in the browser for the languages implemented in MPS. This can be an image based editor that renders the editor in MPS using the default editor definition or an HTML based editor that requires a separate editor definition in a language provided by modelix. Common to both approaches is that the user input (keyboard, mouse) is processed on the server and the update of the projection after a model change also happens on the server. Even in case of the HTML based editor the resulting HTML is computed on the server side. This removes the need to replicate the model into the browser, which would result in a bad performance in case of big models. Running MPS in the cloud requires an alternative to the file system for storing models. modelix implements a data structure that allows replication between all MPS instances connected to the same model server. It is very similar to the git storage format, but instead of files it stores nodes in its key-value data store. To support realtime collaboration, in addition to the snapshot of a version it also stores the operations that were applied on the previous version to produce the new version. Conflicts between concurrent modification are resolved using operational transformation (OT). The usually hard part of OT is to guarantee convergence, meaning that all clients end up with the same result indepent of the order in which they receive changes. This problem becomes trivial, because versions are identified by a hash over all the content. Any divergence will result in a different hash which can easily be detected. The remaining problem is what to do when a divergence is detected. From git we know that switching between versions is fast, because it only has to apply the difference between these versions. The same is true here. Fixing a divergence is as easy as switching to the correct version. If a client doesn’t have any local changes it doesn’t even need to apply the change operations itself. It can just switch to the new version. So in the rare case of a divergence fixing it is nothing special. It’s an operation that happens all the time.","title":"Architecture","component":"modelix","version":"24.1","name":"architecture","url":"/modelix/24.1/explanation/architecture.html","titles":[{"text":"An architectural overview of the modelix project","hash":"_an_architectural_overview_of_the_modelix_project","id":1},{"text":"Editor","hash":"_editor","id":2},{"text":"Model","hash":"_model","id":3}]},"142":{"id":142,"text":"This glossary is a lose collection of keywords used throughout the modelix documentation.

Modelix is a platform to bring models to the web. It consists of multiple components, which can be combined in different ways to support a variety of use cases. It is important to note, that modelix is neither a language workbench in the traditional sense nor a one-size-fits-all solution. The modelix project aims to provide you with building blocks, which empower you to construct your own application with ease. The following table gives an overview over essential components, which you are very likely to encounter when using modelix. For a full list of components check out the components table. Component Short description model-api Untyped API, which allows to interact with models. model-server Server, which persistently stores models. model-client Client, which implements the model-api and connects to a model-server. model-api-gen(-gradle) Component, which generates a typed, domain specific API based on a metamodel definition. The generated API wraps the untyped model-api. As a basic example, you might want to create a web app, which manipulates domain-specific models. In this case we assume a metamodel for such models exists as part of an MPS project. The image above shows how the essential components work together to form the backend for a web application. In this case the metamodel definition is generated from the structure aspect of a language in MPS. For a different use case it could also be from another (custom) source. The web application can then use the domain-specific API to manipulate and store models in the model-server. Of course, this example only scratches the surface of what is possible with modelix. Apart from the individual components, modelix can also provide a system called workspaces. It consists of multiple docker images, which run in a kubernetes cluster. Among other features, this system enables users to use projectional editors inside their browser by running MPS instances in the cloud. Modelix is always evolving.

To make it easier for developers, the modelix platform is currently released twice a year as a single \"platform release\" which references compatible component versions. We aim to provide a Spring release (e.g. 24.1) and an Autumn release (e.g. 24.2). All development in-between is carried out as patches on the releases.

Sometimes we want to implement a feature or expose an API that is experimental. When doing so, we mark the APIs as experimental. In TypeScript, we use the documentation tag @experimental. For Kotlin, we use the annotation @UnstableModelixFeature for an opt-in requirement When marking something as experimental, we document the reason for it being experimental and our plans for stabilizing the feature.

An example in TypeScript can be found here.","title":"Development and Releases","component":"modelix","version":"24.1","name":"development","url":"/modelix/24.1/main/development.html","titles":[{"text":"Development","hash":"_development","id":1},{"text":"Release Cycle","hash":"_release_cycle","id":2},{"text":"Experimental features","hash":"experimental_features","id":3}]},"150":{"id":150,"text":"The following image shows a dense overview of our current roadmap. The aim of this roadmap is to provide you with a more detailed overview of our plans. We have compiled a catalog of our significant areas, which are our top priorities we focus on delivering. In the following we shortly list these key priorities. Below you can find more detailed explanations for each of these. ModelQL: Dynamic query language for on-demand loading overcoming issues associated with upfront data retrieval and optimizing performance MPS 2023 / 2024 Support: Provide support in modelix for newer MPS versions LIonWeb (estimated 24.1): Integration with other web components via a new LionWeb bulk API adapter Model-server services: Streamlined interfaces and structure for services[1] Meta-model in model-server: A way to store the meta-model of corresponding model content in the model-server (foundation for language evolution). GraphQL interface: An endpoint for smaller web applications, leveraging the available tooling ecosystem Projectional text editors in browser: Projectional text editors for browsers, using Kotlin multiplatform to edit models directly or through server-side rendering Graphical Editors: We plan to provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API to enable graphical editors on the web. With the modelix 23.2 release we introduced ModelQL: A dynamic way of loading and writing parts of the model on demand while reducing the number of requests to a minimum. To learn more, head over to the ModelQL documentation and the corresponding How-Tos. While the early version allowed us to provide a quick win for large models, we were not able to finish this feature fully. Especially writing support currently needs to be stabilized and performance can be improved. We also want to integrate ModelQL in our samples project to present a graspable example beyond the documentation. In a larger effort to become MPS version independent, we prepare our plugins and interfaces with MPS to provide preliminary support for MPS 2023 for the modelix 24.1 release. This effort is needed to provide adequate support today, but in the following release 24.2 we plan to fully transition away from dedicated MPS plugins over to IntelliJ Platform plugins. IntelliJ Platform plugins do not require to be written in MPS and are allowed to be created using Kotlin - just like everything else in modelix. All MPS interfacing parts will use the comparably stable APIs provided by MPS to query and modify MPS models, such as the Open API and the SModel. As a result, we do not have to migrate and maintain MPS plugins for multiple MPS versions at the same time. Instead, we have a single Kotlin codebase which can provide the same functionality to all MPS versions. This effort will reduce complexity and potential for bugs and allow us to better test and validate our MPS interfacing plugins. Modelix focuses on a good integration with MPS. But if you are interested in the integration of other modeling technologies then check out the LIonWeb project (short for Language Interfaces on the web). They specify more general interfaces and use the modelix model-server for data storage and exchange in their current prototypes. For 24.1 we want to provide an adapter for the modelix model-server to support the initial LionWeb bulk protocol for model data storage and retrieval. The modelix team co-authored and is involved with the LIonWeb initiative. Modelix already allows you to access model data from any web application, either untyped (i.e. on the M3 layer), or typed (i.e. on the M2 layer or domain layer). As soon as you have model content in a web application the question regarding correct scoping, typing, and other checks arises. In MPS we grew accustomed to easy integration of these different language aspects. In modelix we envision model-server services to do this type of model analysis, checking, and eventually transformation. In fact, this can already be done today: Any application accessing model data from a model-server can provide external APIs for the above-mentioned features. However, we plan to streamline interfaces and approaches used by services to communicate with the model-server. Our goal is to provide a stable basis for services which will encourage re-use and extension. When using MPS, model migrations are made easy using the migration aspect. However, once stepping outside of MPS, migrations may become more difficult. Model migration needs to be carried out across platforms, teams and (web) applications when a new language version is deployed. We want to support a generated API that can work with multiple versions at the same time with which we also can support meta-model versions checks for compatibility. As a consequence, we will need meta-model information in the model-server and plan to add this as a foundation for Language Evolution. Until now, there was no need for this knowledge to be available directly but technically the meta-model is already stored, though implicitly encoded in the storage, but the model-server does not use or interpret this knowledge. We have some ideas we need to further refine and explore in the following releases. As with all other parts of modelix, we prefer using established and state-of-the-art tools. Consequently, for smaller web applications we consider to provide a simple GraphQL endpoint, which can provide immediate benefit. Especially the access to a powerful tooling ecosystem with GUIs, editor integrations, code generation, linting, analytics, and more is a direct win. However, it is important to note, that this approach will not scale: As soon as the model size grows or the strong integration requirements exist, other tools such as our ModelQL or the model-server services are needed. Similar to our previously developed notation language prototype (based on the old shadow models), we want to provide generic projectional text editors in the browser. A default notation is used for concepts without a web specific notation, just as MPS does it. We envision projectional text editor components implemented in Kotlin multiplatform for editing models in the browser, either directly or via server-side rendering. The experience from MPS shows that the requirements for a graphical editor are too diverse to support all of them with a single framework. There are many different frameworks available in the web world where you can choose the one that fits your use case. We plan to only provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API, but not the integration of any diagram framework itself. 1. We understand a service in this context as model-server independent software which operates on model data to provide some sort of derived knowledge. Within the modelix architecture, it does not matter if services run client or server sided, but we want to ensure that services are independent components which have to define their own endpoints and interfaces to the outside. We envision services to provide model validation, checking, transformation, or any other model data modification - features which language workbenches tightly integrate, for example in MPS aspects.","title":"Roadmap","component":"modelix","version":"24.1","name":"roadmap","url":"/modelix/24.1/main/roadmap.html","titles":[{"text":"Key priorities overview","hash":"_key_priorities_overview","id":1},{"text":"ModelQL (estimated 24.1)","hash":"modelql","id":2},{"text":"MPS 2023 / 2024 Support (estimated 24.1)","hash":"_mps_2023_2024_support_estimated_24_1","id":3},{"text":"LIonWeb (estimated 24.1)","hash":"_lionweb_estimated_24_1","id":4},{"text":"Model-server services (estimated 24.2)","hash":"services","id":5},{"text":"Meta-model in model-server (estimated 24.2)","hash":"_meta_model_in_model_server_estimated_24_2","id":6},{"text":"GraphQL interface (estimated 25.1)","hash":"_graphql_interface_estimated_25_1","id":7},{"text":"Projectional text editors in browser (estimated 25.1)","hash":"_projectional_text_editors_in_browser_estimated_25_1","id":8},{"text":"Graphical Editors in the Web (estimated 25.2)","hash":"_graphical_editors_in_the_web_estimated_25_2","id":9}]},"151":{"id":151,"text":"This page represents a fallback page for open TODOs within the documentation.

Each use case uses different components from the modelix platform to create custom solutions. On this page, you can get an overview of all use cases, and see how they are related and what their essential differences are. In the first use case, an MPS project is synchronized to a repository on a model server by utilizing the model-server-sync-plugin. It shows how to make model data, previously accessible only in a running MPS or via files, available through a server. In itself, this use case has little value, but the next use cases build in part on it. See the Use case 1 page for details. In this use case, we connect web frontends to a model server. The web frontends read from and write model data to the model server. One web frontend can be used to edit model data and is implemented with Vue.js. The other one serves as an overview and is implemented with Angular. You can see how changes made in one connected application are instantly reflected in another connected application. You can also connect an MPS to the model server and see how changes made in the application are synced to MPS and vice versa. The frontend applications directly use the model-client JavaScript library that connects to the model server. They also use a TypeScript API generated by the Model API generator from the metamodel to enable type-safe access to data structures provided by the model client. See the Use case 2 page for details. In this use case, a web frontend connects to a web backend, which in turn communicates with a model server. Like in use case 2 model data is synced automatically between the model server, the application and MPS. A backend is needed if you need to control what data a client might read and write. It is also useful to translate data from modelix data structures into a data structure that is suitable for your web applications. The web backend is implemented with Quarkus. It uses the model-client to connect to a model server. It also uses a Kotlin API generated by the Model API generator from the metamodel to enable type-safe access to data structures provided by the model client. For the Angular based web frontend, the web backend provides a custom HTTP- and websocket-based API. See the Use case 3 page for details. This is not strictly a use case but rather a bonus to increase the transparency and visibility of the requests happening in the background. The model-server always provides a /metrics endpoint which allows you to obtain data on several inner workings, such as HTTP connections or JVM statistics. As soon as you start a model-server, you can thus run a dedicated monitoring database (e.g. Prometheus) and a dashboard (e.g. Grafana) to obtain and visualize metrics respectively. See the Monitoring page for details.","title":"Overview of the samples","component":"modelix","version":"24.1","name":"overview","url":"/modelix/24.1/samples/overview.html","titles":[{"text":"Use case 1","hash":"use_case_1","id":1},{"text":"Use case 2","hash":"use_case_2","id":2},{"text":"Use case 3","hash":"use_case_3","id":3},{"text":"Monitoring the model-server","hash":"monitoring","id":4}]},"161":{"id":161,"text":"This use case shows how model data can be synced between an MPS instance and a model server.

Optionally, an MPS project can be run and also synchronize its model data with the model server. One web frontend is the Management application implemented in Vue.js.

A backend is needed if you need to control what data a client might read and write. It is also useful to translate data from modelix data structures into a data structure that is suitable for your web applications. The web backend is implemented in Quarkus.

The data communicated between the model server and web backend are modelix-specific data structures without information about the metamodel.

The backend programmer can use this so-called domain-specific-language API to access model data more type-safely. The web backend exposes a custom application-specific API, which the web frontend uses to communicate and read and write data.

These components include among others the model-server, model-api-gen, model-api-gen-gradle, and light-model-client. All components in this repository have no dependencies to JetBrains MPS. The modelix project uses Gradle to build the individual components. Simply call the following in the top level folder of a repository: ./gradlew build # mac/linux or if you are on windows use: gradlew.bat build # windows Wherever possible we use the latest IntelliJ IDEA IDE to manage projects in our repositories. Consequently, opening any repository with IntelliJ will also allow you to build and eventually contribute. At the moment most modelix artifacts are stored on the itemis nexus with no access restriction. As a consequence, when you build modelix or use modelix components via Gradle there is no repository access setup required. This is optional when you want to obtain modelix artifacts from GitHub packages rather than the itemis nexus server. Most packages are also published to GitHub packages for which a GithHub account and credentials are required. To access GitHub packaged you need to specify your credentials. First of all you will need to generate a personal access token with access to GitHub Packages. The project assumes that your username is available as the variable gpr.user and the token as gpr.key. The easiest way to configure the credentials is copy the example below, paste it into the gradle.properties file in the repository and replace the values with your credentials: gpr.user= gpr.key= Gradle also supports other locations for specifying these properties.","title":"Welcome to modelix.core!","component":"modelix","version":"24.1","name":"index","url":"/modelix/24.1/core/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":2},{"text":"Build components using Gradle","hash":"_build_components_using_gradle","id":3},{"text":"Build from console","hash":"_build_from_console","id":4},{"text":"IntelliJ Idea","hash":"_intellij_idea","id":5},{"text":"modelix Artifact Publication","hash":"_modelix_artifact_publication","id":6},{"text":"How to set up GitHub packages authentication","hash":"_how_to_set_up_github_packages_authentication","id":7}]},"165":{"id":165,"text":"TODO","title":"modelix.core Explanation","component":"modelix","version":"24.1","name":"index","url":"/modelix/24.1/core/explanation/index.html","titles":[]},"166":{"id":166,"text":"When working with large models you will quickly run into performance issues when you try to replicate the whole model into the client. While the data structure for model replication in Modelix supports partial loading of models, you still need a way to describe which data you need on the client. Loading data on demand while traversing the model also results in a poor performance, because of the potentially large number of fine-grained request. A first attempt to solve this problem was to disallow lazy loading and require the client to load all required data at the beginning, before working with the model. A special query language was used to filter the data and an attempt to access a node that is not included by that query resulted in an exception, forcing the developer to adjust the query. While this results in a more predictable performance, it is also hard to maintain and still not optimal for the performance. You have to download all the data at the beginning that you might eventually need, potentially exceeding the available memory of the system. The ModelQL query language provides a more dynamic way of loading parts of the model on demand, but still allows reducing the number of request to a minimum. The downside is that it’s not just a different implementation hidden behind the model-api, but requires to use a different API. The query language is inspired by Reactive Streams and the execution engine uses Kotlin Flows, which is a Coroutines compatible implementation of Reactive Streams. Often it’s useful to know if a stream is expected to return only one element or multiple elements. Project Reactor, another implementation of Reactive Streams, introduced the notion of Mono and Flux to distinguish them. You will also find them in ModelQL.","title":"ModelQL","component":"modelix","version":"24.1","name":"modelql","url":"/modelix/24.1/core/explanation/modelql.html","titles":[{"text":"Reactive Streams","hash":"_reactive_streams","id":1}]},"167":{"id":167,"text":"TODO","title":"modelix.core How-To","component":"modelix","version":"24.1","name":"index","url":"/modelix/24.1/core/howto/index.html","titles":[]},"168":{"id":168,"text":"The model-server provides basic metrics at the HTTP endpoint /metrics.

The zip operation provides a simple way of doing that: val result: List>> = query { db -> db.products.map { val id = it.id val title = it.title val images = it.images.toList() id.zip(title, images) }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.first}, Title: ${it.second}, Images: ${it.third}\") } This is suitable for combining a small number of values, but because of the missing variable names it can be hard to read for a larger number of values or even multiple zip operations assembled into a hierarchical data structure. This can be solved by defining custom data classes and using the mapLocal operation: data class MyProduct(val id: Int, val title: String, val images: List) data class MyImage(val url: String) val result: List = remoteProductDatabaseQuery { db -> db.products.map { val id = it.id val title = it.title val images = it.images.mapLocal { MyImage(it) }.toList() id.zip(title, images).mapLocal { MyProduct(it.first, it.second, it.third) } }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.id}, Title: ${it.title}, Images: ${it.images}\") } The mapLocal operation is not just useful in combination with the zip operation, but in general to create instances of classes only known to the client. The body of mapLocal is executed on the client after receiving the result from the server. That’s why you only have access to the output of the zip operation and still have to use first, second and third inside the query. To make this even more readable there is a buildLocalMapping operation, which provides a different syntax for the zip-mapLocal chain. data class MyProduct(val id: Int, val title: String, val images: List) data class MyImage(val url: String) val result: List = query { db -> db.products.buildLocalMapping { val id = it.id.request() val title = it.title.request() val images = it.images.mapLocal { MyImage(it) }.toList().request() onSuccess { MyProduct(id.get(), title.get(), images.get()) } }.toList() } result.forEach { println(\"ID: ${it.id}, Title: ${it.title}, Images: ${it.images}\") } At the beginning of the buildLocalMapping body, you invoke request() on all the values you need to assemble your object. This basically adds the operand to the internal zip operation and returns an object that gives you access to the value after receiving it from the server. Inside the onSuccess block you assemble the local object using the previously requested values. One use case of the query language is to build database applications that generate HTML pages from the data stored in the model server. You can use the Kotlin HTML DSL together with ModelQL to do that. Use buildHtmlQuery to request data from the server and render it into an HTML string: val html = query { it.map(buildHtmlQuery { val modules = input.children(\"modules\").requestFragment { val moduleName = input.property(\"name\").request() val models = input.children(\"models\").requestFragment { val modelName = input.property(\"name\").request() onSuccess { div { h2 { +\"Model: ${modelName.get()}\" } } } } onSuccess { div { h1 { +\"Module: ${moduleName.get()}\" } insertFragment(models) } } } onSuccess { body { insertFragment(modules) } } }) } buildHtmlQuery and the requestFragment operation are similar to the buildLocalMapping operation, but inside the onSuccess block you use the Kotlin HTML DSL.","title":"ModelQL","component":"modelix","version":"24.1","name":"modelql","url":"/modelix/24.1/core/howto/modelql.html","titles":[{"text":"Independent ModelQLClient","hash":"_independent_modelqlclient","id":1},{"text":"Integration with LightModelClient","hash":"_integration_with_lightmodelclient","id":2},{"text":"Type-safe ModelQL API","hash":"_type_safe_modelql_api","id":3},{"text":"Run query on an INode","hash":"_run_query_on_an_inode","id":4},{"text":"Complex query results","hash":"_complex_query_results","id":5},{"text":"Kotlin HTML integration","hash":"_kotlin_html_integration","id":6}]},"171":{"id":171,"text":"You can run a light version of the model-server directly in MPS via the dedicated MPS as Modelix Model Server Plugin, which is published over at the JetBrains Marketplace.

Based on these directions, Gradle tasks will be generated, which can be run to trigger the corresponding synchronization. Internally, the node data will be bulk exported from the source endpoint and stored as JSON files.

doc | Repository | buildfile | Artifacts: Nexus GitHub Packages The model-api-gen.gradle.plugin is a Gradle plugin that wraps the functionality of the MPS solution for metamodel-export and Model API Generator. It provides an additional Gradle task which will apply a 2-staged process: MPS metamodel export to JSON (optional) In the first step the metamodel-export MPS solution is executed by the plugin to export the MPS structure aspect (i.e. the metamodel) to JSON files. In case your metamodel comes from another source this is an external entry point: As long as you can export your metamodel to JSON, you can use model-api-gen. To use JSON from another source or JSON files from a previous export, you can skip this step by simply specifying a directory, which contains the JSON files, in the configuration of the gradle task: metamodel { //... jsonDir = File(\"path/to/json/dir\") } As a result, all MPS-specific configuration settings will be ignored and the specified directory will be used for the next step. JSON to model API generation In the second step, the previously generated JSON files containing the metamodel are being used to generate the typed API using the Kotlin/TypeScript generator in model-api-gen. Inside of the metamodel block the following settings can be configured. setting type description javaExecutable File Location of the Java executable moduleFolders ArrayList Directories, that contain the language modules mpsHome File Home directory of MPS mpsHeapSize String MPS heap size specified as a String, e.g. \"2g\" for 2GB includedLanguages Set Set of languages, for which an API should be generated includedLanguageNamespaces Set Set of language namespaces, for which an API should be generated includedConcepts Set Set of concepts, for which an API should be generated includedModules Set Set of modules, for which an API should be generated jsonDir File Directory containing JSON files, which represent a metamodel.

Bringing models to the cloud requires an alternative to the file system (and git) based storage of models. Modelix implements a data structure that allows replication between all MPS instances connected to the same model-server. It is very similar to the git storage format, but instead of files it stores nodes in its key-value data store. To support real-time collaboration, in addition to the snapshot of a version, the model-server also stores the operations that were applied on the previous version to produce the new version. Conflicts between concurrent modification are resolved using operational transformation (OT). The usually hard part of OT is to guarantee convergence, meaning that all clients end up with the same result independent of the order in which they receive changes. This problem becomes trivial, because versions are identified by a hash over all the content. Any divergence will result in a different hash which can easily be detected. The remaining problem is what to do when a divergence is detected. From git we know that switching between versions is fast, because it only has to apply the difference between these versions. The same is true here: Fixing a divergence is as easy as switching to the correct version. If a client does not have any local changes it does not even need to apply the change operations itself - it can just switch to the new version. So in the rare case of a divergence fixing it is nothing special and is an operation that happens all the time. While this component is independent of MPS, it is possible to replicates the data of the MPS internal module repository into a running model-server. This can be achieved using the modelix MPS plugin: One can connect an MPS instances to a model-server, upload the current module repository, and keep it synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor - both options are supported at the same time.

Most packages are also published to GitHub packages for which a GithHub account and credentials are required. To access GitHub packaged you need to specify your credentials.
