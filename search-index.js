MPS is running in headless mode on the server with an HTTP server installed as a plugin. The browser connects to that server and receives the HTML and JavaScript code required for the interactive model editor. A second plugin connects to a model-server and replicates the data into MPS’ internal module repository. All MPS instances connected to that model server will stay synchronized. This can also be a local MPS instance without a web editor. Both options are supported at the same time. The next image gives an overview over the different docker images running in the kubernetes cluster. The model server uses an Apache Ignite cluster and just provides a REST API on top of it. A high load can be distributed over multiple instances. Running multiple MPS instances for scalability is possible, because the model has the same state on all instances. If you want to run MPS instances with different configurations (languages, plugins) or allow external instances to connect to the model server, a reverse proxy is used to forward the request to the correct instance. To access the web editor a user has to login in with a google account first. An OAuth proxy takes care of that and adds an HTTP header with the users e-mail address to the request. modelix provides an editor in the browser for the languages implemented in MPS. This can be an image based editor that renders the editor in MPS using the default editor definition or an HTML based editor that requires a separate editor definition in a language provided by modelix. Common to both approaches is that the user input (keyboard, mouse) is processed on the server and the update of the projection after a model change also happens on the server. Even in case of the HTML based editor the resulting HTML is computed on the server side. This removes the need to replicate the model into the browser, which would result in a bad performance in case of big models. Running MPS in the cloud requires an alternative to the file system for storing models. modelix implements a data structure that allows replication between all MPS instances connected to the same model server. It is very similar to the git storage format, but instead of files it stores nodes in its key-value data store. To support realtime collaboration, in addition to the snapshot of a version it also stores the operations that were applied on the previous version to produce the new version. Conflicts between concurrent modification are resolved using operational transformation (OT). The usually hard part of OT is to guarantee convergence, meaning that all clients end up with the same result indepent of the order in which they receive changes. This problem becomes trivial, because versions are identified by a hash over all the content. Any divergence will result in a different hash which can easily be detected. The remaining problem is what to do when a divergence is detected. From git we know that switching between versions is fast, because it only has to apply the difference between these versions. The same is true here. Fixing a divergence is as easy as switching to the correct version. If a client doesn’t have any local changes it doesn’t even need to apply the change operations itself. It can just switch to the new version. So in the rare case of a divergence fixing it is nothing special. It’s an operation that happens all the time.","title":"Architecture","component":"modelix","version":"2023.R1","name":"architecture","url":"/modelix/latest/explanation/architecture.html","titles":[{"text":"An architectural overview of the modelix project","hash":"_an_architectural_overview_of_the_modelix_project","id":1},{"text":"Editor","hash":"_editor","id":2},{"text":"Model","hash":"_model","id":3}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"This glossary is a lose collection of keywords used throughout the modelix documentation.

We deploy all relevant artifacts to the itemis Nexus server as well as GitHub Packages With many components being in various development stages - from stable to early and conceptual - they are released individually for each repository. Generally, we follow the Semantic versioning scheme for releases. However, anything based on JetBrains MPS (e.g. MPS plugins or extensions) are prefixed with the corresponding MPS major and minor version number followed by our own patch version number. For example, the org.modelix.mps-model-plugin version 2021.2.103 is the 103rd release which is compatible with MPS 2021.2.*. To make it easier for developers, the modelix platform is currently released twice a year as a single \"platform release\" which references compatible component versions. We aim to provide a Spring release R1 and an Autumn release R2. All development in-between is carried out as patches on the releases. This release cycle starts from 2023 with the first release on the MPS Community meetup in May: 2023.R1.

This component can only provide read only access as the json-bulk-model-access is read only. ▶️ For more details, see the API via json-bulk for details. model-server as a source This backend provides access to the model by connecting to a running todo:model-server. It is implemented using Quarkus and can provide read access to the underlying model. Additionally, a websocket for push notifications about ongoing model changes is provided. This is realized using websockets exposed by the model-server. ▶️ For more details, also see the API via model-server component for details. The dashboard provides access to model knowledge through a browser. As it is conforming to the OpenAPI specification, the dashboard is able to obtain the model content from both backend implementations. However, the dashboard is consequently limited by the chosen backend.

This dashboard is a single-page app showing content obtained from the intermediate REST APIs. A user cannot edit that models from the browser. You can build this subproject individually from the parent folder via via gradle: ./gradlew spa-dashboard-angular:build To run this application you will need a component which provides an API implementation conforming to the OpenAPI spec. Thus, you need to start one of the available OpenAPI implementations in this project: Either start the rest-api-json-bulk implementation, or alternatively you can start the rest-api-model-server implementation. Check the documentation of the corresponding project parts on how to start them. Make sure you have the correct ports defined in the API URLs. This app expects 8090 by default.

Not all features of modelix are shown here so this is not a complete demo of everything modelix can do. The primary focus of the examples is to show how you can work with language and models defined in MPS in combination with modelix. (Meta-)models are integrated outside of MPS using JVM (Java/Kotlin) and/or web frameworks/tools. Everythin is inteded for you to come up with tyou own use-cases and architectures based on what is provided here. None of the examples try to reuse editors defined in MPS. If your goal is to reuse MPS editors as is then modelix itself ships with a projector integration to achieve this. While all the examples use the same language defined in MPS they are not meant as one complete example but rather as individual parts. The purpose of the examples is to give inspiration of what is possible with modelix and make you think and envision your own use cases. To build this component via gradle, simply call the following in the top level folder: ./gradlew build # mac/linux gradlew.bat build # windows At the moment most modelix artifacts are stored on the itemis nexus with no access restriction. As a consequence, when you build modelix or use modelix components via gradle there is no repository access setup required. This is optional when you want to obtain modelix artifacts from GitHub packages rather than the itemis nexus server. Most packages are also published to GitHub packages for which a GithHub account and credentials are required. To access GitHub packaged you need to specify your credentials. First of all you will need to generate a personal access token with access to GitHub Packages. The project assumes that your username is available as the variable gpr.user and the token as gpr.key. The easiest way to configure the credentials is copy the example below, paste it into the gradle.properties file in the repository and replace the values with your credentials: gpr.user= gpr.key= Gradle also supports other locations for specifying these properties. Build component using Gradle Once the initial build has completes feel free to inspect the Use cases and start components as described for each use case. Alternatively, you can inspect and edit the project with the code editor of your choice.

The language intentionally doesn’t use expressions, creating editors for expressions by hand is very cumbersome and at the time where these samples were created modelix has no support for generating these editors for you. The main concepts of the language are: Room: where lecture are held. Each room has a maximum capacity of students, a name and some additional properties. Lecture: Have a name, some description and reference a room where they are held. And also have a schedule which determines when they are held and if they repeat through the whole semester or are a one time lecture. Student: A student with a name and birthday.

This layer is meant educational as no noteworthy abstractions from the language itself happen in this definition. It intends to show how one introduces a clearly defined domain-specific abstraction decoupling the language engineering (meta-modeling) and the web development. We provide two backends (i.e. implementations of the API layer): The API via json-bulk and API via model-server components. ▶️ For more details, see the OpenAPI component documentation. This project provides two implementations of the openapi domain abstraction. MPS as a source ⚠️ Deprecated! This backend provides access to the model by obtaining the model knowledge directly from a running MPS instance. It is implemented using ktor and connects to the json-bulk-model-access plugin running inside of MPS. This component can only provide read only access as the json-bulk-model-access is read only. ▶️ For more details, see the API via json-bulk for details. model-server as a source This backend provides access to the model by connecting to a running todo:model-server. It is implemented using Quarkus and can provide read access to the underlying model. Additionally, a websocket for push notifications about ongoing model changes is provided. This is realized using websockets exposed by the model-server. ▶️ For more details, also see the API via model-server component for details. The dashboard provides access to model knowledge through a browser. As it is conforming to the OpenAPI specification, the dashboard is able to obtain the model content from both backend implementations. However, the dashboard is consequently limited by the chosen backend. This components requires running any of the available OpenAPI implementations to obtain model knowledge from. ▶️ For more details, also see the Dashboard for details. ⚠️ TBD ⚠️ TBD 1.

Not all features of modelix are shown here so this is not a complete demo of everything modelix can do. The primary focus of the examples is to show how you can work with language and models defined in MPS in combination with modelix. (Meta-)models are integrated outside of MPS using JVM (Java/Kotlin) and/or web frameworks/tools. Everythin is inteded for you to come up with tyou own use-cases and architectures based on what is provided here. None of the examples try to reuse editors defined in MPS. If your goal is to reuse MPS editors as is then modelix itself ships with a projector integration to achieve this. While all the examples use the same language defined in MPS they are not meant as one complete example but rather as individual parts. The purpose of the examples is to give inspiration of what is possible with modelix and make you think and envision your own use cases. To build this component via gradle, simply call the following in the top level folder: ./gradlew build # mac/linux gradlew.bat build # windows At the moment most modelix artifacts are stored on the itemis nexus with no access restriction. As a consequence, when you build modelix or use modelix components via gradle there is no repository access setup required. This is optional when you want to obtain modelix artifacts from GitHub packages rather than the itemis nexus server. Most packages are also published to GitHub packages for which a GithHub account and credentials are required. To access GitHub packaged you need to specify your credentials. First of all you will need to generate a personal access token with access to GitHub Packages. The project assumes that your username is available as the variable gpr.user and the token as gpr.key. The easiest way to configure the credentials is copy the example below, paste it into the gradle.properties file in the repository and replace the values with your credentials: gpr.user= gpr.key= Gradle also supports other locations for specifying these properties.

Of course the MPSLanguageRegistry.getInstance would throw an exception if our iNode instance isn’t a Rooms instance. The generate class for a Room concept: concept Room extends BaseConcept implements INamedConcept instance can be root: false alias: short description: properties: maxPlaces : integer hasRemoteEquipment : boolean children: > references: > Will look like this: java package University.Schedule.structure; /*Generated by MPS */ import jetbrains.mps.lang.core.structure.BaseConcept; import jetbrains.mps.lang.core.structure.INamedConcept; import org.modelix.mps.apigen.runtime.INodeHolder; import org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull; import org.modelix.model.api.INode; import org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable; /** * Generated for http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=r%3Adfa26643-4653-44bc-9dfe-5a6581bcd381%28University.Schedule.structure%29%2F4128798754188010580 */ public class Room extends BaseConcept implements INamedConcept { public class Properties extends BaseConcept.Properties implements INodeHolder, INamedConcept.Properties { @NotNull @Override public INode getINode() { return Room.this.getINode(); } @Nullable public Integer getMaxPlaces() { String propertyValue = getINode().getPropertyValue(\"maxPlaces\"); if (propertyValue != null && !(propertyValue.isEmpty())) { return Integer.parseInt(propertyValue); } return null; } @Nullable public Integer setMaxPlaces(Integer value) { if (value != null) { getINode().setPropertyValue(\"maxPlaces\", Integer.toString(value)); } else { getINode().setPropertyValue(\"maxPlaces\", null); } return value; } @Nullable public Boolean getHasRemoteEquipment() { String propertyValue = getINode().getPropertyValue(\"hasRemoteEquipment\"); if (propertyValue != null && !(propertyValue.isEmpty())) { return Boolean.parseBoolean(propertyValue); } return null; } @Nullable public Boolean setHasRemoteEquipment(@Nullable Boolean value) { if (value != null) { getINode().setPropertyValue(\"hasRemoteEquipment\", Boolean.toString(value)); } else { getINode().setPropertyValue(\"hasRemoteEquipment\", null); } return value; } } public class Children extends BaseConcept.Children implements INodeHolder, INamedConcept.Children { @NotNull @Override public INode getINode() { return Room.this.getINode(); } } public class References extends BaseConcept.References implements INodeHolder, INamedConcept.References { @NotNull @Override public INode getINode() { return Room.this.getINode(); } } private final Properties properties; private final Children children; private final References references; public Room(INode node) { super(node); this.properties = new Properties(); this.children = new Children(); this.references = new References(); } public Properties getProperties() { return this.properties; } public Children getChildren() { return this.children; } public References getReferences() { return this.references; } } At the moment it’s not possible to regenerate the API as part of the CI/gradle build, that’s why the generated sources are checked into the repository. This limitation is specific this example and is somehow caused by the MPS build failing to load the right languages during the build. Other projects are successfully using the api-gen code generator within their CI/gradle build. The limitation will get fixed in the future but for now the generated Java code is checked into the repository.","title":"MPS Courses Domain Language & model","component":"samples","version":"0.2.*","name":"mps","url":"/samples/latest/samples/mps.html","titles":[{"text":"Language","hash":"_language","id":1},{"text":"Generated API","hash":"_generated_api","id":2},{"text":"Limitations","hash":"_limitations","id":3}]},"35":{"id":35,"text":"This component of a single openapi.yml file which probides the OpenAPI specification of the REST API implementations serving as examples in this project. The described API provides an additional domain-specific abstraction of the courses domain[1]. The intention of this abstraction is to provide an example on how the use of modelix can be abstracted for eventual consumer apps, such as the Angular based dashboard. The development process thus can follow a API-first approach. Consequently, this openAPI provides a contract of the API behaviour for web teams and a language engineers. There are currently three implementaitons of this OpenAPI specification: API via json-bulk (deprecated) API via model-server API via modelQL 1. This additional abstraction admittedly does not really provide fancy abstractions for this domain. Its purpose is rather educational for you to understand the option to add an additional layer separating web development from language engineering. You do not have to do this.

Additionally, a display in the main hall shows all the lectures of the current day. This use case envisions a scenario where a system/service outside of MPS wants to consume the content of models defined in MPS (i.e. read only access). In this simple case, a user does not need to edit these models from the browser. The Dashboard, an angular app that serves the content of a model, implements such a simple single page application (SPA). There are two variations (with sub-variations) of this use case: No automatic update in the SPA: The display refreshes periodically (e.g. every 15 minutes). With automatic updates in the SPA: A display in the main hall would want to show the newest information at all times. Each variations can further be sub-divided base on the used storage backend. Wither MPS is used to store the model information (e.g. when running an MPS instance in the cloud), or alternatively the modelix model-server is used. Depending on the components used, not all features are available. For example, the json-bulk-model-access plugin for MPS is deprecated and does not support writing to the model.","title":"Use Case 1: Dashboard view","component":"samples","version":"0.2.*","name":"usecase-1","url":"/samples/latest/samples/explanation/usecase-1.html","titles":[]},"44":{"id":44,"text":"","title":"UC 2: TODO","component":"samples","version":"0.2.*","name":"usecase-2","url":"/samples/latest/samples/explanation/usecase-2.html","titles":[]},"45":{"id":45,"text":"","title":"","component":"samples","version":"0.2.*","name":"usecase-3","url":"/samples/latest/samples/explanation/usecase-3.html","titles":[]}},"components":{},"componentVersions":{"modelix/2023.R1":{"displayVersion":"2023.R1-beta","title":"Modelix Documentation","version":"2023.R1","name":"modelix","prerelease":"-beta","asciidoc":{"attributes":{"env":"site","env-site":"","site-gen":"antora","site-gen-antora":"","attribute-missing":"warn","data-uri":null,"icons":"font","sectanchors":"","source-highlighter":"highlight.js","site-title":"Modelix Documentation","site-url":"https://docs.modelix.org","page-pagination":true,"page-partial":true},"sourcemap":false},"url":"/modelix/latest/index.html","navigation":[{"items":[{"content":"General","url":"/modelix/latest/index.html","urlType":"internal","items":[{"content":"Introduction","url":"/modelix/latest/index.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Development, Releases, and Roadmap","url":"/modelix/latest/main/roadmap.html","urlType":"internal"}]}],"root":true,"order":0},{"items":[{"content":"Tutorials","url":"/modelix/latest/tutorial/index.html","urlType":"internal","items":[{"content":"Build component using Gradle","url":"/modelix/latest/tutorial/build-component.html","urlType":"internal"}]}],"root":true,"order":0.2},{"items":[{"content":"How-To Guides","url":"/modelix/latest/howto/index.html","urlType":"internal","items":[{"content":"General"}]}],"root":true,"order":0.4},{"items":[{"content":"Reference","url":"/modelix/latest/reference/index.html","urlType":"internal","items":[{"content":"General","items":[{"content":"Components","url":"/modelix/latest/reference/components.html","urlType":"internal"}]}]}],"root":true,"order":0.6},{"items":[{"content":"Explanation","url":"/modelix/latest/explanation/index.html","urlType":"internal","items":[{"content":"Architecture","url":"/modelix/latest/explanation/architecture.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Modelix Goals","url":"/modelix/latest/explanation/goals.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Glossary","url":"/modelix/latest/explanation/glossary.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Repository Structure","url":"/modelix/latest/samples/explanation/structure.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Use Case 1: Dashboard","url":"/modelix/latest/samples/explanation/usecase-1.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"samples:explanation/usecase-1-a.adoc","url":"/modelix/latest/samples/explanation/usecase-1-a.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"samples:explanation/usecase-1-b.adoc","url":"/modelix/latest/samples/explanation/usecase-1-b.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Use Case 2: Write from Web","url":"/modelix/latest/samples/explanation/usecase-2.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"samples:explanation/usecase-3.adoc","url":"/modelix/latest/samples/explanation/usecase-3.html","urlType":"internal"}]}],"root":true,"order":0.8}]},"samples/0.2.*":{"displayVersion":"0.2.*","title":"modelix.samples","version":"0.2.*","name":"samples","asciidoc":{"attributes":{"env":"site","env-site":"","site-gen":"antora","site-gen-antora":"","attribute-missing":"warn","data-uri":null,"icons":"font","sectanchors":"","source-highlighter":"highlight.js","site-title":"Modelix Documentation","site-url":"https://docs.modelix.org","page-pagination":true,"page-partial":true},"sourcemap":false},"url":"/samples/latest/samples/index.html","navigation":[{"items":[{"content":"Samples","items":[{"content":"Welcome","url":"/samples/latest/samples/index.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Tutorials"},{"content":"How-To Guides"},{"content":"Reference"},{"content":"Explanation","items":[{"content":"Repository Structure","url":"/samples/latest/samples/explanation/structure.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Use Case 1: Dashboard","url":"/samples/latest/samples/explanation/usecase-1.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"samples:explanation/usecase-1-a.adoc","url":"/samples/latest/samples/explanation/usecase-1-a.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"samples:explanation/usecase-1-b.adoc","url":"/samples/latest/samples/explanation/usecase-1-b.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Use Case 2: Write from Web","url":"/samples/latest/samples/explanation/usecase-2.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"samples:explanation/usecase-3.adoc","url":"/samples/latest/samples/explanation/usecase-3.html","urlType":"internal"}]}]}],"root":true,"order":0}]}}}})
