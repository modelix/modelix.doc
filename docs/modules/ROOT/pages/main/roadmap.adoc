== Key priorities overview

The aim of this roadmap is to provide you with a more detailed overview of our plans.
We have compiled a catalog of our significant areas, which are our top priorities we focus on delivering.
In the following we shortly list these key priorities.
Below you can find more detailed explanations for each of these.

// ------------- 24.1
* ModelQL: TODO
* MPS 2023 / 2024 Support: TODO
* LIonWeb (estimated 24.1): Integration with other web components out there via a new LionWeb bulk API adapter
// ------------- 24.2
* Model-server services: TODO
* Meta-model in model-server (foundation for Language Evolution): A way to store the meta-model of corresponding model content in the model-server.
// ------------- 25.1
* GraphQL interface: TODO
* Projectional text editors in browser: TODO
// ------------- 25.2
* Graphical Editors: We plan to provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API to enable graphical editors on the wev.


// ------------- 24.1
=== ModelQL (estimated 24.1)
// TODO

=== MPS 2023 / 2024 Support (estimated 24.1)
// TODO

==== LIonWeb (estimated 24.1)
Modelix focuses on a good integration with MPS.
But if you are interested in the integration of other modeling technologies then check out the LIonWeb project (short for Language Interfaces on the web).
They specify more general interfaces and use the modelix `model-server` for data storage and exchange in their current prototypes.
For 24.1 we want to extend the modelix `model-server` to support the initial LionWeb bulk protocol for model data storage and retrieval.
The modelix team co-authored and is involved with the LIonWeb initiative.


// ------------- 24.2
=== Model-server services (estimated 24.2)
// TODO

=== Meta-model in model-server (estimated 24.2)
// foundation for Language Evolution
// TODO reword this
When using MPS, model migrations are made easy using the migration aspect.
However, once stepping outside of MPS, migrations become more difficult.
Model migration needs to be carried out across platforms, teams and (web) applications when a new language version is deployed.

We want to support a generated APIs that can work with multiple versions at the same time with which we also can support meta-model versions checks for compatibility.
We have some ideas we need to further refine and explore in the following releases.


// ------------- 25.1
=== GraphQL interface (estimated 25.1)
// TODO

=== Projectional text editors in browser (estimated 25.1)
// TODO


// ------------- 25.2
=== Graphical Editors in the Web (estimated 25.2)
The experience from MPS shows that the requirements for a graphical editor are too diverse to support all of them with a single framework.
There are many different frameworks available in the web world where you can choose the one that fits your use case.
We plan to only provide the data synchronization and the generation of a TypeScript model API, but not the integration of any diagram framework itself.
