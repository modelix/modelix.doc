= Modelix Overview
:navtitle: Overview

The goal of this quick overview is for you to understand, what modelix is, what it is not and how it might be utilized.

== What is Modelix?

Modelix is a platform to bring models to the web.
It consists of multiple components, which can be combined in different ways to support a variety of use cases.

It is important to note, that modelix is neither a language workbench in the traditional sense nor a one-size-fits-all solution.
The modelix project aims to provide you with building blocks, which empower you to construct your own application with ease.

== Essential components

The following table gives an overview over essential components, which you are very likely to encounter when using modelix.
For a full list of components check out the xref:reference/components-table.adoc[components table].

|===
|Component | Short description

|`model-api`
|Untyped API, which allows to interact with models.

|`model-server`
|Server, which persistently stores models.

|`model-client`
|Client, which implements the `model-api` and connects to a `model-server`.

|`model-api-gen(-gradle)`
|Component, which generates a typed, domain specific API based on a metamodel definition.
The generated API wraps the untyped `model-api`.

== Basic example using essential components
image::example-essential-components.svg[]

The image above shows a basic example of how the essential components work together to form the backend for a web application.
In this case the metamodel definition is generated from the structure aspect of a language in MPS.
But it could also come from other sources (symbolized by the question mark).

Of course, this only scratches the surface of what is possible with modelix.

== Modelix workspaces

Apart from the individual components, modelix can also provide a system called `workspaces`.
It consists of multiple docker images, which run in a kubernetes cluster.
Among other features, this system enables users to use projectional editors inside of their browser by running MPS instances in the cloud.

== What's next

Modelix is always evolving.
